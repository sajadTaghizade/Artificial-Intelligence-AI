    Predicting Student Performance with Machine Learning
  </h2>
  <p>
    This is the third assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course. The primary goal is to use <strong>Machine Learning</strong> techniques to predict the final grade of students in the AI course based on their demographic, social, and academic characteristics.

        üìñ Project Description
      </h3>
      <p>
        This project is divided into two main phases. [cite_start]The first phase focuses on <strong>data preprocessing and feature engineering</strong> to prepare the dataset for modeling. [cite: 265, 274] [cite_start]The second phase involves developing, training, and evaluating several <strong>classification models</strong> to predict student performance. [cite: 265, 289]

      <h3>
        üìà Dataset Overview
      </h3>
      <p>
        [cite_start]The dataset contains student academic performance records, including demographic, social, and educational features such as age, gender, family status, study hours, past failures, and previous course grades. [cite: 268, 270, 271] [cite_start]The final grade in the AI course (`finalGrade`) is the target variable. [cite: 273]
