Lyric
"Cryptic psalms Amidst the howling winds A scorching source of agonizing bliss Beneath its veil Mysteries of a life beyond Can you hear it? Sons and daughters with hearts ablaze Forsaken ones in deaths embrace Chant this hymn, behold in awe The blessed curse, abort by law Come reign with us Enslave yourself unto the beast Extend your lust Tyrants of dark supremacy Sons and daughters with hearts ablaze Forsaken ones in deaths embrace Chant this hymn, behold in awe The blessed curse, abort by law Vomiting our gospels at the trembling pillars of heaven Gods eyes wont close but endure our wrath forever Hymn of the forsaken The ashes of sanity Lies at our feet Drenched in excrements we devour it in contempt Cleansed through regurgitation ablaze We vomit forth the law of abhorrence Through blood we deny Tetragrammation Signals of death carved in flesh and bone The crystal ball has shown us our morbid fate Now lit the torch and abominate Sons and daughters with hearts ablaze Forsaken ones in deaths embrace Chant this hymn, behold in awe The blessed curse, abort by law You are just a feeble abortion of a faith to be erased by claws The crimson dawn is upon you We storm forward to annihilate Begone"
Im sleeping tonight with all the wolves Were dreaming of life thats better planned As long as the wind that falls isnt longing for revenge I should be safe We should be safe Shes two bitter ends So watch as those friends Enjoy suns embrace when Stories theyve told Through ears on the walls Speak softly to them all
"Wings of the darkest descent Fall from the realm of dark From the blackest fall of creation Doomed by its end Winds of chaos blow through my soul Wings of the darkest descent shall fall Lurking evil shadowed darkness Far beyond the light of day Blessed be the wings of chaos Blowing through your soul When evil consumes my creation Wings of the darkest descent shall fall Black descends on the wings of the crucified Black descends on the wings of the crucified Black descends on the wings of the crucified Winds of chaos rip through my soul Fall of doom shall grasp my withered soul, nothing remains My voice shall speak in ancient tongues of old Darkness bestowed Black descends on the wings of the crucified Black descends on the wings of the crucified Winds unto the chaos blow through my souls Chaos of the demon wings unfold They unfold"
"[Verse 1] Norrid Radd was my real name Had a job that I hated every day Until that one day I told my boss To just shove that damn JOB Cause I found a place I could rest my head, maybe call my home Trapped on this planet I know Found a bunch of other super powered people like before Fought against evil on my silver surfboard Cause everybody wants the power cosmic Skate across space thats our department I know alien races kinda scared when they think That the herald is there to cause fear But Im trying my best for the past mistakes Try to do good through time and space Cause Ive seen every star and Ive seen every planet But I always seem to come back to the same place [Hook] Well maybe I can be your Norrin Radd Maybe I can give you what you never had You could make a wish on a shooting star Then I could catch a wish right in my hand Maybe I can be your Norrin Radd Show you every star that you saw with your dad And we can find adventure in the middle of space And always come back to the same place [PostChorus] To Earth Just as long as you surf Lets go back to Earth Its where I met you first Back to earth Just as long as you surf Lets go back to earth Yeah [Verse 2] One day, saw a shooting star And you wished very hard for it to go far So far so the people of the galaxy could all Make a little wish when they saw But you didnt realize that it was just me Up in the sky so you see And I never stop, and I never quit And you can leave every wish right here with me And I would take that wish to the ends of the galaxy So that every alien race would just have to see Some good, some bad, but I cant explain Cause humanity survived through the tragedy Back then, well mostly just you When you see Norrin Radd, then youre just food For Galactus, but Im so glad I met you And Im glad that you smiled when you saw me too [Hook] To Earth Lets go back to Earth Its where I met you first Its where I met you first Yeah Lets go back to earth Lets go back to earth Its where I met you first Its where I met you first Yeah [Hook] Now when i say 6 1 Yall say 6 616, 616 When i say power Yall say cosmic power cosmic, power cosmic When i say norrin, yall say radd norrin radd, norrin radd Peace [Hook fading out]"
"Deep in the dungeons of doom and despair Sneak to a place in the dark Eke out a living you can stay alive Better pay heed what I say Cleft of the rocks are too small to escape No daylight in my grey world There is no torch, no candle, no view To see moon and landscape my mate Pestilence In the dungeons of doom Of cold ashes and coom Where rags cant keep warm One last glance To the dungeons of doom Ill decay in the ruins Burn off my disease Pestilence In the dungeons of doom Of cold ashes and coom Where rags cant keep warm Trembling in the ruins of despair Death came as my release Who put me out of my misery There is no way to survive Verminous food you cant even relish Dont want to be buried alive A virus corroded my body and soul Let me go to devils hollow My temple is burning always yearn to die Get rid of my sorrow"
"Outcast since the day I was born never belonged to this world Walked alone in the shadows tried to find a reason A voice in my head spoke to me Seek the knowledge of mankind, my son The other side calling me I must leave everything behind Life is not for me the other side Ancient knowledge was shown to me closed myself to this world Walked alone in the shadows I had found a reason The voice spoke to me again It is your fate, obey your destiny. Spreading everything I had learned opened myself to this world Walked alone in the shadows I had lost the reason The voice spoke to me one final time Your work is done, time for you to die."
"Yeah [Verse 1 Classified] They might say I lead a simple life, the type that dont excite And yes I like to smoke more than light til night I realize I got a problem, Im high way too often And only seem to acknowledge it after I indulge in it Pull in my driveway, walk through my front door Then make a bowl of cereal to conquer my hunger See I like to eat before I slumber Brushin my teeth and gettin clean, helps me to find my comfort Jump in my bed and turn the TV back on I feel like I was just here, the day dont ever last long I feel like everydays a cycle, Ive learned to accept it Theres a lot of scenes to see, I need to learn to direct it I turn the TV off and start brainstormin Try to figure what Im gonna do in the mornin I know what it brings, I wonder whats in store though I wonder what the hell Im gonna do for tomorrow do for tomorrow ... [Male Narrators Voice] Goodnight, well see you tomorrow"

Your pride Why should your pride be so restricted? Restricted to a mere fraction of this earth. This earth from which we have all evolved. This earth where all of its people are downtrodden. Downtrodden by all those who stand to prosper from exploitation. Downtrodden by those whose slime infests your weak minds. Your weak minds.
"Searching, To fight all the fears in your life. Feeling... That something has to be done. Screaming !!! To make them see youre here ! Creating... To give birth to what you stand. You will have to learn, More than once or twice. That chance can help you too ! You will have to fight, Hard for your rights, Yes believe it too ! Cards were all dealt, On the day I was born, And I choose, the ones To go on and on... Winning, Falling, Its like, when you roll the dice, Winning, Falling, It can happens to your life, When you roll the dice ! I can hear the calling of destinity, Even tough I will face the difficulties, You have to make more than one sacrifice, If you really want, To breack the ice, Sometimes youll have to ask yourself What is the meaning of my inner self? Some people will say Youre a fool ! But sometime the hazard, Can make you rule ! Lines were all traced On the palm of my hand,? And I follow the ones To go on... Reaching... The goals that you made in your life. Losing... Sometimes its the price you have to pay ! Sands are all falling, On the hourglass, And I ride the ones To go on and on... You rollthe dice You roll the dice ! You win you loose !"

"a parody of Sir MixALots song Baby Got Back I feel sick and I just might die And I honestly dont know why But when my doc walked in with a huge seringe And a big grin on his face I passed out Which doctor is mine? Then I learned the witch doctor is mine What in Gods name am I wearin? My butts stickin out of the rear end Oh my God, I wanna go back home And go to the bathroom My homeboys came to visit The doc saw my cut and then he kissed it A termometer he pulled out But he doesnt wanna put it in my mouth I said back up! Back up! Cause you aint gonna shove it in my butt I feel much better now To Hell with my medicine My bed, lead! Hes poking me all over my head The food is made of slime And it really should be a crime Take the average dinner and eat this stuff It comes right back up So cooks yeah cooks yeah Does it taste better coming back up hell yeah My doctor said eat it eat it eat it eat it Itll make you feel alright Doc is a quack! My doctors a quack! The nurse was big and round She took up the whole town I just couldnt help it when I saw her My puke went flyin, without even tryin She knocked me down on the floor Then Clear zap clear zap I aint takin those pills Thats birth control, or couldnt you tell The doctor came to test my reflex But theres no reflex in The middle of my chin He hit me and my mouth caved in Im lookin at all the other docs Reputations solid as a rock Why cant my Doc be smart Im stuck with Groucho Marx Somebody get me some help please call a paramedic My docs pathetic Cause he wants to drill a hole in my head Im gonna scream till the break of dawn Whats my life worth? He thinks Im gonna give birth This guy wants to search my body cavity Id rather be impaled on a fence Im restrained, Im in pain And my underwears got a big stain Does this hurt? yeah Does this hurt? yeah As he keeps on pokin my gizzard He said open up, say ahhhh Then he shoved the little stick in my eye Doc is a quack! My doctors a quack! They wheel me around in a gernie I feel like Im in Weekend At Bernies But Bernie never had to go through all of this torture Which cost a fortune All I want is to get out alive He grabbed me and told me to cough But he enjoyed it a little too much Some people think I should try to sue him Cause my futures lookin real grim He cut me and enjoyed it I didnt move fast enough to avoid it He wants to cut open my brain He thinks itll stop the pain But I know thats wrong and I just cant fight it Its Appendicitis A garden hose he shoved in me This aint no I.V He said he gave me a sedative But I think he gave me a laxative This knuckleheads really a chump And now I gotta take a dump Im not sick somebody tell him If I live through this Im gonna kill him This guys really gettin on my nerves His treatment is for the birds So shove his medicine back in his face And get me out of this place Doc is a quack! My doctors a quack!"

"Im the result of an ageless redemption a body with a heartless convention a face with a smile thats been shut down for years facing the facts of my generation...cause Im a sinner, a winner, my blood is getting thinner I might as well get another life cause Ive been there I know whats been said and I know whats been done dont you tell me Im the only one, cause I... I will be there looking for something Coming straight out of nothing, just killing time Facing those walls so black, so vile I really am waiting for nothing Coming straight out of something, just killing time Facing those walls so black, so vile Now put your trust in a solid machine Filled with words that have never been seen A plague to insatiable souls left to die Charged with mankinds raw energy I rumble, I stumble My memory starts to crumble I cant refuse whats haunting my dreams Have I stumbled? On my way to a created perfection I penetrate the gates of rejection Theres no determination, echoes of a failed gallery Theres yet extermination, inside us all screaming"
"Underneath the blackest soil I lay down my warm beating heart And deep beneath the frozen ground I bury down my deepest thoughts Because the road Ive chosen Is free of fortune and desire Or the mundane toil and worry Because the trail Ive taken Leads down into the darkest shore Where the stars have passed away Tonight, the world is burning Black smoke hides the skies Dark clouds rise up swirling Shadows engulf the land By the side of forsaken path I leave behind my old shadow Into the deep under these shores I drown my broken memories For something to change Something has to give For something to grow Something has to yield I kiss the light goodbye"

Lick your lips for me one last time So I can see the reflection of horror on your face The dying whim and other words deemed poetic Everyone has their own path to follow But their tracks are on my back Ive been crying sunscreen for so long So then when you bring the sunshine you cant see my tears How can you say that you will let this fly forever? When you dont know how long that is Trying to understand whats incoherent will only bring more pain than its worth And I dont know how long to go on like this Seeing through an insomniacs perspective Brings a bunch of new points of view Today I watched the sun rise on grey and clouded skies Ive been crying these tears for so long

I hate it, I stress with the strongest language Repeat it and replay it, chopchop it and fade it No matter whatever ratings, you should have my pictures hanging Everyones style is so basic, I wish that I could erase it I wish that I could take off, I need you to give me space And Im not impressed much less amused with things that these rappers saying So I use you for entertainment as youve been properly named Hope your attitude aint contagious, a disease that needs to be tamed Been sick since I had begun Dope, I bring in a ton Hope you see it as fun Joke, but dont see me as one [Hook x2] Theres no way I can stop Gunning like its Black Ops Everywhere I am got people on the highest watch Cop it from the med shops Skating on the blacktop I would take it straight up if it was my last shot Theres no way you should stop With one up in the stash box And I got my top dropped to keep the game on lock Fully automatic when I spit But I can sweep the streets without it Any claim they say they cleaner than me I highly doubt it, uh"
"I guess Ill walk alone in the pouring rain I hold this candle that burns in your name With every teardrop that falls from my eyes I cant forget you, the memory never dies But I cant help feeling that Ive been betrayed cause Im the one thats left out here in the pouring rain I feel the touch of a hand thats so familiar How I long for yesterday, I long for yesterday! Pain is so real its a shame that a heart must feel such a loss In this world that is cruel, full of storm and ocean I lost your love when I let you go I wish that you could have stayed with me And now youve turned and said goodbye Its raining tears and my heart is breaking Something inside me has died Now that youre gone from my side And all that is left are these damned memories Of lost love and gained sorrow Love is so real... its a God that is never changing And love shall remain in my heart as I keep on living I lost your love, but Ill let you go I wish that you could have stayed with me And even though youve said goodbye It took some time but my heart is mending Something inside mes alive It seems that my soul has survived Tomorrow will come and I will be free To love someone, to love another"
"[Intro] So what am I saying? I dont really know, because its not important [Verse Rozz Dyliams] It was 97, I was working off the pager We were smoking blunts, listening to Skunk Anansie With the MAC11 and all the accessories out on the kitchen table Mossimo bags and party favors Hunter green Grand Prix, 93 A cactus with sunglasses on the antenna The only one who accompany me Back and forth, state to state, releasing the energy rap From a mobile trap, with Ohio plates Had to pay the cost, and suffer pain and loss All my protectors and collectors look like Rayna Foss All over they faces, then Im skating off I love to talk about myself, I just hate to talk To someone of a lesser status, who dont understand the madness And what the frelling hell is up with the pressure patterns Dylan keep it going til it hurt Off into the summer, hitting summer with the damn work This is a demonstration, of activation, across the nation A gift to all nations from all sides, let the love get multiplied Open your mind, and open it wide, and go deep inside And let your spirit be the guide To a spiral dragging dreaming sequence A newfound, unlocked personal achievement No jive lip guff talk bitch boy bein Just straight emceein Keeping it hardest of the hardcore, with a vivid vision Of destruction and disorder for a modern war Ima keep it rockin til my body rotten, long forgotten I got mental illness, so a nine to five is not an option Ima crush your head in with a 909, and keep on stomping If you doesnt comprehend, you never will, you never got it [Chorus Rozz Dyliams] It went from Finast, to Tops, to Tops, to Heinens, and thats when it stops It went from Finast, to Tops, and Tops, to Heinens, and thats when it stops [Outro] Oh my god I feel like Ive been gone for a century Our lives today, we dont need to know anything about nothing. People keep talking about bullshit. So what does it matter what I say, really? It doesnt, because people talk too much. Let me put my two cents in on that. No, really. I ask you to look deep into yourself, and ask yourself, Where is the authentic me in this world when theres so much lack of authenticity when so many people are putting on this facade to appear certain ways in order to make people happy, or tell people what they think they are, when theyre really nothing at all? When I looked into my true self today, you know what I saw? Do you know what I saw when I looked into my true self today? Absolutely nothing. I saw nothing. And what are you supposed to do... when you see nothing? You could only build on top of that Youre lucky if you see nothing Cause from there, comes all of this"

Theres a sound Across the alley Of cold metal Touching skin And you can see If you look in her window That she has gone and cut Her hair again In straight lines Straight lines Those soft golden lights in the morning Are now on her wooden floor The wind has swept them through the apartment She wont need them Any more Any more Any more Shes cut down On her lovers Though she still dreams Of them at night Shes growing straight lines Where once were flowers She is streamlined She is taking the shade down From the light To see the straight lines Straight lines She wants to cut through the circles That she has lived in before She wants to finally kill the delusions She wont need them Any more Any more Any more But theres a sound Across the alley Of cold metal Too close to the bone And you can see If you look in her window The face of a woman Finally alone Behind straight lines Straight lines

To the republic for which it stands We have sacrificed and met demands The rhetoric of a sovereign nation The searing screams of exasperation If logic is the money of the mind Than clearly we have spent ourselves blind Unite Unite Depreciate the American dollar Magnify this quest for power Alas when everything is said and done Who will be the anointed one Its so easy just to push the blame When at stake is a politicians fame Its so easy just to push the blame And bring on endless suffering Have we not learned from yesterday Or are we blinded by hypocrisy Have we not learned from yesterday Tempers flaring every word that you say Have we not learned from yesterday You cannot finance destiny The art of losing Is not hard to master Its so plain to see That we are falling faster Aim your guns high You have to learn to walk before you learn to fly Aim your guns high You have to learn to walk before you learn to fly Aim your guns high But when the bullets fall back to earth they may take your life To the republic for which it stands We have sacrificed and met demands The rhetoric of a sovereign nation The searing screams of exasperation One nation under God That doesnt seem to be the case One nation under fraud Emancipate this dying race

"These days, I tried, I tried, I tried But life kept me next to her, why? Like a reed, I fold but dont break Since these moments, nothing distresses me Behind my misanthropic and insensitive wall My love is a so beautiful corpse Rain and wind remind me your death But like a reed, I fold but dont break The river that feeds me is only silence and scorn Thats why Im so black... Since these moments nothing distresses me But like a reed, I fold but dont break So nobody cares of... My doubts... My cries... My fears... My pain... My dreams... Me Yet I realize that, like an oak, Im tough"

"They came here when the sun was high. The sea was calm to meet them. From out of the wind above the hills. Come a fleet of godly men. Borne on strong winds from the otherworld. Shrouded by magical mists The Tuatha De Danann came in their Great magical mystical ships. Nuada, king of Tuatha De, Turned his eager sharp eyes Towards the land of his ancestral home, The valleys, The sea and the skies. He was a giant among mortal men, A hero among the immortals Who led his peoplewarriors strong Back to the land of their fathers. The Fir Bolg, Who were in Eireann before the Tuatha De Danann. Sent streng their mighty champian to parley with the future king. Breas was sent by Nuada to find out his intent, I greet you as a brother, said Streng By Eochai Ive been sent. The terms of battle were laid, half of Eireann Breas asked, The Fir Bolg said this cant be paid, the time of goodwill has now passed. Both sides made plans, they prepared their wells of healing, Tribes and clans led by the chieftains and their kings. The sun shone down on helmets, shields and swords, Midsummers dayThe two armies walked in haodes Towards Magh NaiThe Fir Bolg followed their chietains, And swept towards the Tuatha DE like waves crash on the beaches. The clash of sword and shield, The splintering of bone, The Fir Bolg would not yield, Though they heard their peoples moans. The naked hillmen warriors, were forced back through the fight, Followed by his bodyguard, The Dagda took their lives But the ground was piled high with the dead of the Tuatha De All surviving warriors fled to live and fight another day. We have been defeated but tomorrows another day Summon your courage. Prepare yourselves, Tomorrow the Fir Bolg we slay Four more days of battle came and many fine warriors fell, Mothers lost their fighting sonsThe wounded healed in wells. Nuada lost his strong right arm, Now he will lose his throne, The sons of Nuada killed Eochai, But they too were overthrown. Streng led the Fir Bolg to the fort and met with the injured, Nuada, Both men declared a truce and Eireann was fairly divided."

"If I had a crystal ball, I would throw it against the wall Cause some things you just dont wanna know So dont try to read my palm or predict what well become Cause the real thing just needs space to grow I do believe in us, but But you cant fast forward through The kinda deep only time can prove Whats the rush, baby, trust what faith can do CHORUS Lets not play the game of love with scared money Lets not say what well become Lets just roll the dice and throw away the cards You dont have to push so hard Cause the gypsy in me needs to roam your heart You know I would live my life Out of a suitcase every night Before Id let you tie me down So just lean back and relax Feel your bare feet in the grass And let love run on open ground I do believe in you, but You cant tell a bird not to fly You cant tell the sun when to shine Whats the rush, baby, we can take our time CHORUS The finest tapestry takes patience and the ability to wait For each thread to support the bigger picture and the larger purpose And in the fearless, reackless pursuit of intimate love It is not the destination its the journey"

"In this hall of marbled walls in another Dimension where time heeds no calls Its neither day its neither night, eternal Twilight away from the light Traveling through time and through space Blinded by the grace Shooting stars guide my way, Cosmic tide cannot lead me astray. Seen the signs so many times, Stones turn to vapour and life declines. A flash of light and all turns black, Mountain falls and bursts with a crack. travelling through time and through space blinded by the grace Visions of sorrow fill my eyes, always the Same as i travel on through time. Blackbrowed memories hides in the skies, They travel inside me as I watch another crime. Visions of sorrow fill my eyes, always the Same as i travel on through time. Blackbrowed memories hides in the skies, They travel inside me as I watch another crime. Shooting stars guide my way, Cosmic tide cannot lead me astray. In ancient tales forgotten by now, Priests and kings pledged their vow. So i send my curse to earth, Forced to create a new rebirth Traveling through time and through space Blinded by the grace Visions of sorrow fill my eyes, always the Same as i travel on through time. Blackbrowed memories hides in the skies, They travel inside me as I watch another crime."

Real talk, yo this mic is like a compass I use it when I feel lost or wanna reach a higher summit And these words are like the paths, man sometimes they get abundant But my brains a blade or razor, trail blazing when Im cutting And I love it. Man I can feel this music in my veins And I know its in the strains zooming through my DNA Thats what I try to demonstrate every time that Im pressing play From present day til I watch the globe rotate from heavens gates"

Someone who believes sex is the pinnacle of a relationship and not the base of the Pyramid Someone I enjoy being with even when shes not naked and in my bed Someone I connect with emotionally, psychologically, spiritually Someone whos worth the wait Someone who believes Im worth the wait Someone who doesnt insist on protection cause shes not afraid of me or anything I Might have contracted Someone who will be glad to Mother my kids Someone who wont hate her child because he looks like me Someone who will never try her best to eradicate my place in her memory Someone who knows when her breasts hang low and her wrinkles fold I will not trade her For a porno and my right hand Someone who understands that it takes a strong man to control his passions Someone who looks forward to loosing them Some who will put that song on repeat and ooh wee until we faint from fatigue then wake The next morning and feel, no, shame. Cause we have the same last name And our nasty is holy So thanks for the offer Dr. Lover, but Ill wait for one who also suffers, and well cure Each other"

"Quite some time ago, I came across a tweet from someone asking Why would Nicki Minaj name her album The Pinkprint? She is no Jay Z. That is disrespectful to his legacy. This made me sit back and think because I never felt like she was disrespecting a legacy. I thought she was only creating hers, all the while paying homage to someone she looks up to. A blueprint by definition is a design plan or other technical drawing. Jay Zs success story is HipHops goto plan or blueprint for success in the music business. Do the girls not need their own plan for success stories in this misogynistic game we call HipHop? Does Nickis name on Forbes Hip Hop Cash Kings list mean nothing in terms of success? I think people, like the guys , I see saying this are missing the point and reading into the situation completely wrong. Theyre still stuck in the past wanting that old Hip Hop sound a sound no one is really using in the mainstream circuit anymore. Some believe Nicki is comparing herself to Jay Z from a lyrical standpoint. No matter how you feel about Nickis lyrical capabilities, I dont think her album title decision meant her album would be like The Blueprint sonically at all, more conceptually speaking. I believe she meant that shes showing female rappers what has to be done to win in this NEW day and age of Hip HopRap musicwhat Jay Z showcased when he did The Blueprint. Even in spite of Nicki naming her album The Pinkprint, why would you expect Nicki to drop a Blueprint album anyway, sonically speaking, when Jay Z doesnt even make Blueprint type of music anymore? It makes no sense. The game plan for female rappers has to be different than the boys. Thats a proven FACT. Females who tried to be successful and aqcuire longevity as a rapper following the guys game plan, where are they now? No one truly cares enough to know. Women like Lauryn Hill, Queen Latifah, and Missy made their own rules, just like Nicki is doing now. Nicki is both singing and rapping on tracks like Lauryn and Queen Latifah did. Nicki is furthering her acting career like Lauryn Hill and Queen Latifah did. Nicki is blatantly unapologetic for her oddness like Missy was. All the while, Nicki is successfully establishing herself as a mogul with tons of business ventures like Queen Latifah still is. Could this be the key to femcee longevity? Well see. To continue, as said by radio personality, Peter Rosenberg and many others, Nicki is the most influential female rapper ever in terms of global reach and sales. Whether you like Nicki Minajs music and choices or not she has the updated game plan for the success of a female rapper in her possession. We know this because she is both creating it and winning. Through her triumphs and tribulations, Nicki teaches the upcoming females what should or should not be done. However, when speaking about Nickis moves it should be what can be done. Shes a mogul who has knocked down the doors the music industry tried to henge shut, for a second time, after the downfall of female rappers prior to Nicki. The Pinkprint will be another statement of all this and more. Additional Thoughts ADDED 11.3.14 After the release of The Pinkprints deluxe edition album cover, I began to have further thoughts about Nickis whole concept. Though I still stand behind the above stated points. Since fingerprints are unique per individual, what if the fingerprint on the cover represents Nicki, herself, being the pinkprint? What if shes telling people that she is the guideline to success as a female rapper? That is certainly a bold statement from the humble rapper. Nevertheless, her theory has not been proven wrong. ADDED 11.7.14 V Magazine released an interview with Nicki Minaj today. Nicki explained to Patrik Sandberg how she wants people to have a glimpse of her life after hearing The Pinkprint. When I play this album for people, no matter how emotional or how hard the record is, it seems like it makes people excited, its a conversational piece, and they feel like theyre looking through a peephole at my life. Maybe The Pinkprint deluxe edition album cover wasnt created to allude to Nicki being the pinkprint. Instead, the fingerprint could be reinstating the albums more personal content ADDED 12.4.14 In the December 2014January 2015 issue of Complex Magazine Nicki was interviewed by Lauren Nostro, who recalled her sit down with Nicki in an article called The Real Her. LN Jay Zs The Blueprint inspired the title The Pinkprint and the idea of laying the blueprint for female rappers to come. What similarities do you see between you right now and Jay circa The Blueprint? NM I cant. I have no idea what he was doing before The Blueprint dropped. Its not that literal. People keep asking me about Jays The Blueprint and they think Im doing something like that. I made reference to The Blueprint because Jay is the biggest rapper of our time. The name of the album was inspired by Jay but not the body of work. I do think that its going to create new rules, though, in [the way] that [The Blueprint did]. Similar to my opinion, Nicki denies The Pinkprint and Blueprints sonic comparability and instead agrees that itll lay down new rules. About two years ago Nicki informed the world saying, My careers been the Pinkprint. I could not agree with her more. New females shouldnt expect to receive Hip Hops formula through one album, but through every move she has made in her career."
"Vast is the emptiness growing inside, like a black hole sucking me in. A hollow casket buried deep, no ruin to cling onto. A destitute room without the comfort of despair, bleaker than the face of a demon. Dark is the shadowside, weary and cold. A haunted place where hopelessness grows. Out of its own accord the earth runs to dust to dust through my hand. Im lost in a haze, found in perpetual sleep. A near mortal sting, deadlier than a voodoo snake, sings me lullaby. In this deserted place I welcome you... I welcome you. Im lost in a haze, found in perpetual sleep. A near mortal sting sings me lullaby. A vehicle broken and restored by unconditional love, the body is a vessel of Gods glory. As if by a chemical trick, Im sedated with imagery. An elusion of truth and desire. Incidents I cannot recall, drowned in motion circular. A familiar dullness, the wheel of the wasteland."
"My Mother,do you believe in me? Did I turn out to be the person you wanted me to be? My Father, do you see yourself in me? Did I turn out to be the person you wanted me to be?

Ill miss you when your gone but I thank god you taught me how to carry on. And I am gasping for air. What am I suppose to do, when I have no one to look up? This is what I feel like, I am nothing, I am no one. The coast Line it gets higher. I just stand there and watched it sink. Ill miss you when your gone but I thank god you taught me how to carry on.

"Alone in the silent night I heard their screams inside Crying out for help But noone listened The demon within I refused to let go of For I loved its sins It showed me the pleasures of suffering Those beutiful dreams, That turned into nightmares Those wonderful moments That crumbled to dust And I am a soul of all and nothing Cosmical reality,wich they call insanity With a mindraping torment I surrendered my beliefs To this dying fairytale I have fallen and risen again Stronger every time Awaiting the step that would lead us to tragedy Conquer all fears and to make it devine I have eaten the forbidden fruits And burned down the bairnaked tree By that I close a chapter of a misery Foretold in my dreams"
"If you want to race, my engine starts to roar, Cos now its time to show you That if you dont want to die, Just try to keep in mind the road is not a joke... Red light is turning into green... Tires are spinning and burning! Faster! Faster Im driving my life... Dont try to escape, my wheels are commanding my dreams Listen what I say! horsepower through my veins And fuel to keep my heartbeat And if you still dont know I was born to win my goals, And this is my road... The ending line is coming near... And once again I win! Faster! Faster Im driving my life... Dont try to escape, my wheels are commanding my dreams After the race I see it clear, a feeling of glory is into me... I cannot stop, my life goes on and Deep inside my heart is a V8! Faster! Faster Im driving my life... Dont try to escape, my wheels are commanding my dreams Faster! Faster Im driving my life... Dont try to escape, my wheels are commanding my dreams"
"When my dusk is drawn in the twilights gleam A tear does fall in silent stream. When I raise my eyes for to see the light I go through the shadows vastrous might. And I wont see when the morning redeems the sad voice of the tender night A sad voice, and it seems like some whispering of goodbye. When my destiny emerges from the other side There is no place for me to hide. When I close my eyes for to never dream again Think of me every now and then And I wont see when the morning redeems the sad voice of the tender night A sad voice, and it seems like some whispering of goodbye."

"Closed society the avant guarded name the password Tight lips Broken spirit locked behind a painful stone cold chest Reach into the valley of the shadow of success Over the cold shoulder I cant breathe deep or roll away the stone Sweet Jesus my relief From tongues lashing, blind eyes flashing, trash can smiles Limited words of infinite smallness Peering back from the unknown Mindless mayhem To the victor go the spoils As long as that can stand on dead mans bones Screaming from the devils pulpit Intellectual incest, incestual intellect Open minds, open mines Like a lump in the throat...incomplete.

"I turn around a last time in this big sinister street, my god, the fog insmoothes the tear that slowly drifts down along your cheak. From the windows, dull and dirty, dozens of white and macabre looks scrutinize us as if it was to announce that this time will be the last... And I think of you again, crouched on myself, where the drops of sad water of an october rain trickle on my face, I think of this langorous smile again, more precious than your nudity, this carnal smile, ecstatic, that projects me for an instant again in a fantastic whirl of desolation. Im the angel of desolation, the angel of my own loss, the angel of a shattered life on the wild flanks of a smile. And I pour a thin and sad tear that shatters itself in a thou sand pieces on the streets from where your look haunts and kill me. Forget me, ravage me and kill me. Oh drink my life in a carnal impulse of desire, dream and fly me away on the peak of despair, because Im the angel of desolation. Yes, Im..."

"When the streetlights fade. Warm rain like judgement descends. Their voice numbs me. Speaking words in a dead tongue. I have walked a road that lead me back to you. From a window our glances met. My true colours I cannot hide. The landscape has changed. You dont recognise me. These pictures slowly fade. Memories wither, they are all gone. Further down the steps get steeper. You haunt me in my dreams. I let go and fall deeper. This will be the end of me."
"Moments languish in their absence while silence moans Paralyzed in dormancy, lifeless slumber drowning in emptiness Senses still flicker awaiting the hopeless awakening to a vague travesty of being Carrying human body in a long dead soul Ive abandoned the flame once burning within Seeking only the depths of fathomless stillness Surrounded by wills of the wisp in this reeking swamp Where demons swarm by my side Once I gazed upon a mere reflection of light As if through the eyes of the living Reflection has gone and will never return I curse this sight to the lowest pit of damnation"

The morning sun beam Finds a man in black With a cruel face No marks of grace The tools of his trade Seem scary on the back Against the wall He uses them all Seeing him makes grown men weep The eyes of him their flesh to creep And his axe puts them to sleep eternal Doomed in line Waiting for the call Staring at the traces of blood all around Their lined faces Hearing the sound of the Mans head dropping to the floor Falling axe Sprays blood on the wall Another head to the top of the mound Quiet whining echoes from the walls The last words before the blood pours Master of his craft Everybody scare His gloomy skill It is to kill In solitude lives he Because no one dare To be with him His name is grim Seeing him makes grown men weep The eyes of him their flesh to creep And his axe puts them to sleep eternal Doomed in line Waiting for the call Staring at the traces of blood all around Their lined faces Hearing the sound of the Mans head dropping to the floor Falling axe Sprays blood on the wall Another head to the top of the mound Quiet whining echoes from the walls The last words before the blood pours

Im in hell Crouched in the corner A shell of man Locked behind this mask Forever Darkened Forever Darkened Locked this mask over my face Just enough light to see And I can barely breathe A brand new kind of hell My voice is screaming And the echos deafening Im in hell Crouched in the corner A shell of man Locked behind this mask Forever Darkened Forever Darkened Forever Darkened

"Weve lost it all, but in the ashes weve found whats been gone for so long. From the deepest pain comes the greatest joy. Remember that if nothing else. And those days we spent our nights running from are never far behind We owe them nothing, but well never get away. So well pay our debt with blood and sweat from these moments. Just words and the hearts where they were born. Our pockets are as empty as our heads, and thats just how it should be. Were sick and were tired but were finally happy. Sometimes all it takes to find a home is to leave. And a thousand miles is all it took this time. Weve lost it all but what matters is tonight tomorrow the same. Tonight, were home, and no matter where we are well never be alone."

"Extraordinary efforts are being made To hide things from us, my friend Some stay up into the wee hours To search their souls Others undress each other in darkened rooms The creaky old elevator Took us down to the icy cellar first To show us a mop and a bucket Before it deigned to ascend again With a sigh of exasperation Under the vast, earlydawn sky The city lay silent before us Everything on hold Rooftops and water towers Clouds and wisps of white smoke We must be patient, we told ourselves See if the pigeons will coo now For the one who comes to her window To feed them angel cake All but invisible, but for her slender arm"

I hear a trace of the ocean noise Fascinated...! The move of waves is like a voice Hero come near I can hold on with a tight rope Captivated...! Ive got a hope For her I could put up with the nymph for long For her I could escape from the soft sirens song For her I had to face the women delight And nobody could defeat me in fight Just for her"

Inflame your passions within our depravity, give yourself over to sin. You wont emerge without transformation... Flesh our soul will win. Forced to sever the ties to this world which is bound by lies. Youre free from original sin, forced to find what is hidden within.

Your one desire controlled by perversion, compelled by lust within. Forced to sever the ties, to this world which is bound by lies. Youre free from original sin... Release what was hidden within. Forced to lay, locked away, made to serve... Another 120 days.

"Release of violent hatred exerted physically Upon the fleshy body of my enemy Defying all their gods, I sacrifice for mine Alive, yet tortured badly, you realize Theres no eternity, there is only now You flood with memories as I rip out your bowels The pain makes you reflect, a nostalgia A portal opens as I inflect trauma Now forsaken, you are asking, Why is it me? The question of why you are here, now profusely bleeding You feel your faith escape you as I pound your skull With a hammer, over and over, until youve had enough Losing consciousness, you mumble to yourself Reciting a prayer to save you from this hell Your vision blurs, your cries now slurs, you feel your self slipping Until I wake you with the pain of your skin being shredded Amputating, lacerating, preparing to eat I feel my hunger growing as you writhe and scream The moon is full and bright as I extract your spine, Holding it above my head, staring into your eyes Lunacy Brutality Eaten by me Lycanthropy"

"A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces An airline ticket to romantic places A fairgrounds painted swings These foolish things remind me of you A tinkling piano in the next apartment Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant And still my heart has wings These foolish things remind me of you You came, you saw, you conquered me When you did that to me, I knew somehow It had to be The winds of March that make my heart a dancer A telephone that rings but whos to answer Oh, how the thought of you clings These foolish things remind me of you"
"From California to the longest island To that sleepy Midwest town where I was born I have walked across this globe searching for something Now I find myself right here,outside your door I have found myself again outside your door And its driving me... If I say something would it make a difference? Its so strange to find home in the face of a stranger For so long it felt like I was falling down And I couldnt wait to finally hit the ground Oh if only I could say the words to make you stay But Ive been through this and heartbreaks all Ive found And its driving me... After everything Ive done,after every song Ive sung You should know that youre the greatest thing Ive ever touched And every breath you breathe It helps me to believe Life is folding and unfolding and unfolding Right in front of me"
"Friends Ive lied more times than Ive been caught And too many times I take more than I give And when I want my way the way I want Im hopeless Everyday I have to die so I can live Sometimes I get angry I just scream and yell I think Id rather just go to Hell But when I finally shed my pride And let the Holy Spirit reach me from the inside I rise up like Lazarus in John 11 I throw out my grave clothes Put on the armor of the Lord I rise up like Lazarus Dry all the tears Mary cried When I fall on my knees I rise Oh sometimes I want to sing along When the crow sings her nasty song Like Mary and Martha Please dont let our brother die But how quickly I forget the story The painful day before Gods glory was revealed When Jesus cried I rise up like Lazarus in John 11 Throw out my grave clothes Put on the armor of the Lord I rise up like Lazarus Dry all the tears Mary cried When I fall on my knees I rise So let the grace of God wash over me all my days As long as skin and bone hold onto me Cause Lord I know till the day You free me from my sin Your love will take me in Just as I am not as I should be So I rise up like Lazarus in John 11 Oh, I throw out my grave clothes Put on the armor of the Lord I rise up like Lazarus Dry all the tears Mary cried When I fall on my knees I , oh rise I rise up like Lazarus in John 11 Oh, I throw out my grave clothes Put on the armor of the Lord I rise up like Lazarus Dry all the tears Mary cried When I fall on my knees I rise"

"[Verse 1] I wasnt taught how to get a job But I can remember dissecting a frog I wasnt taught how to pay tax But I know loads about Shakespeares classics I was never taught how to vote They devoted that time to defining isotopes I wasnt taught how to look after my health But mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell [Verse 2] Never spent a lesson on current events Instead I studied The Old American West I was never taught what laws there are I was never taught what laws there are Let me repeatI was not taught the laws for the country I live in But I know how Henry the VIII killed his women Divorced beheaded died, divorced beheaded survived Glad thats in my head instead of financial advice [Verse 3] I was shown the wavelengths of different hues of light But I was never taught my human rights Apparently theres thirty, do you know them? I dont Why the hell cant we both recite them by rote? I know igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks Yet I dont know squat about trading stocks Or how money works at allwhere does it come from? How does the thing that motivates the world function? Not taught to budget and disperse my earnings I was too busy there rehearsing cursive Didnt learn how much it costs to raise a kid or what an affidavit is But I spent days on what the quadratic equation is Negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared Minus 4ac over 2a Thats insane, thats absolutely insane They made me learn that over basic first aid [Verse 4] Or how to recognize the most deadly mental disorders Or diseases with preventable causes Or how to buy a house with a mortgage If I could afford it cause abstract maths was deemed more important Than advice that would literally save thousands of lives But its cool, cause now I could tell you if the number of unnecessary deaths caused by that choice was prime Never taught presentday practical medicines But I was told what the ancient Hippocratic method is Ive got a headache, the pain is ceaseless What should I take? Um... maybe try some leeches? Could we discuss domestic abuse and get the facts Or how to help my depressed friend with their mental state? Um... no, but learn mental maths Because you wont have a calculator with you every day! They say its not the kids, the parents are the problem Then if you taught the kids to parent thats the problem solved then! All this advice about using a condom But none for when you actually have a kid when you want one Im only fluent in this language, for serious? The rest of the world speaks two, do you think Im an idiot? They chose the solar over the political system So like a typical citizen now I dont know what Im voting on Which policies exist, or how to make them change Mais oui, je parle un peu de Francais So at 18, I was expected to elect a representative For a system I had never ever ever been presented with [Chorus] But I wont take it Ill tell everyone my childhood was wasted Ill share it everywhere how I was educated And insist these pointless things dont stay in school"
"[Verse One] If your mother saw you now would she be pleased or disgusted? At your choice to remain at the bottom of the bucket Your fellow crabs, they know youre not to be trusted Cause when they rise to the top you do what you can to make em plummet On the other hand, I stand with the mic stands posture Scan under my bed to sever the heads of any monsters Took a dive into the eye Jupiter to backstroke through lava Relaxing with a carton of cancer sticks and flavored java If youve noticed, Ive scripted my existence on these pages With obesity that leaves stretch marks on stages If knowledge is the key to society shackles and cages I guess youre forever trapped in syntax and shoelaces I rock the crowd like Im without sin so I cast the first stone Though I live in a glass house insulated with quilted poems Stay still to the loan, with head above water, melodic poems From bravado, left speakers blown when emitted through microphones [Hook] Every line is a spear Every fans heart a target Every circles not a sphere Every soldiers not a sergeant If every fountain is clear Every sniper is a marksmen You cant win so stop trying Youre not ill so stop lying Every check doesnt cash Every scale doesnt balance Every verse doesnt last Every skills not a talent Every question is not asked Every test doesnt challenge You cant win so stop trying Youre not ill so stop lying [Verse Two] Explore your fears and bipedal on this trek with me Invade the psyche of life with leprosy This limb doesnt want to fall off so words protect me Wanna hold hands with mic stands so eyes reflect me On stages, pages open soaked in ecstasy Give me a little space to erase the token referee Throwing flags with needle name tags injecting me With some form of abnorm psychological weaponry With a fine point pen in sight of my notebook next to me Plus an eye full of the gene pool in which God subjected me I spill epics to the skeptics rejecting me Not to gather more friends but make my enemys start respecting me Stay controlling the game so they wont be ejecting me You flagrantly foul players from the bench to fill your destiny This Orphanage adopts hip hop to join the infantry Beg your pardon but we watered the garden for starving victory Walked this paved path shackled in misery Uncovering clues to unlock the steel box of the industry Chained to a bed with hobbled legs trapped in Misery Held hostage in a cabin by a fan with family missing me Forcing me to spit out a classic of spastic energy Placing my mind on the line, theres no time to be finicky I sever heads of snakes causing my mate to tempt me With the forbidden fruit, inducing fiction in history [Hook]"
"Take me in a heavy sleep In adventures Ive never seen In a dimension before death Mentally lost always have been If none of us return from death There is so a weaving To explain life In a place There is no life What I adore Is lost behind All the figures feel like me How can I feel as pain does not exist Here knowledge meets nothingness A lost dream, a psychotic feast If none of us return from death Theres so weaving To explain life In a place There is no life What I adore Is lost behind I have no advice How I could It seems so cordial But in a way its not Delusions lead my like Delusions name all my life With a picture of an empty heaven A clear distinction Between death joy"
"Am I still here? Am I hidden from your sight? Did I suddenly expire did I walk into the light? But maybe there is time one more trick up my sleeve There is still so much to say Can anybody hear me? Im suffocating Cant you hear me shout Wrapped up in soft voices like a reverential shroud Im suffocating Cant you hear me cry A constant flow of faces on parade before my eyes Can anybody hear me? So much to say The secrets I have kept Stories from the good old days Can anybody hear me? So much to say The politics of people And the games we choose to play This is not a coma I am resting my eyes Tired of the noise and scared of the lies But for one night only I will captivate you all With one last piece of magic, one last miracle Im suffocating Cant you hear me scream? As you stab me in the arm in search of somewhere good to bleed Im suffocating Cant you hear my prayers? A rain of gentle hands trying hard to show they care I could fly so high and free If my soul wasnt anchored to me Ive got one last show I have to do And my powers of illusion will amaze and puzzle you Pull the rabbit from an old and battered hat Cut the lady into pieces, just like that I will mesmerize and dramatize and obfuscate And Ill finish with undoubtedly the greatest The greatest escape! Can anybody hear me? Am I hidden from your sight? Did I suddenly expire did I walk into the light? Can anybody hear me? Am I hidden from your sight? Did you see me turn to stone, or go missing in the night? Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear me? Did I suddenly expire did I walk into the light? Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear me? Have I turned into a statue, or gone missing in the night? Can anybody hear me?"
"Of wretched god and sullen ties Is nothing hard for me to think Yet, I rather think of something far more admissible Sour face of just thoughts, I disincline! Forcing you at cold death torment Laugh not certain when you die There is no such hope as the end No hope is given until you fry Coventrizing ownself to pus, and cowardice, I despise! A leerlike tantrum in my eyes Seek no death nor hope Defile is my foe Cross the line to life Cross the line to life! Heed the seething of my heart Which Ive sent to the burning realms And even if God gave me torment And tried to cleanse my soul A mortal man with mortal sin Hate within remains Now life begin! Twine in thoughts of the arriving Twine through the archaean Athwart the etherial luminary singe I claim the death of pain Forced to admit the nature of enough And rend the cloth of done The locution enmity is gone A mortal man with mortal sin Hate within remains Heed the seething of my heart Which Ive sent to the burning realms Heed the seething of my heart Which Ive sent to the burning realms Ebonrinded now returns Yet pure Hear not a far cry of fraudulent! Fear not a far cry of fraudulent dream..."

He was made for battle Driven by the gun Disobeying orders his ego would be on early grave He was known amongst them by his yellow hair Now hell shoot his gun for the very last time This will be Custers last stand What a great day to die And justice will be done And the eagle will fly When the battle has begun And a hero will rise He will be the one theyll all be talking about In a thousand years or more He was born a warrior One of a kind He will always be that Nothing could ever change his mind The spirit cant be broken The heart wont ever change Therell be no retreat No surrender He will not give up the land that is his What a great day to die And justice will be done And the eagle will fly When the battle has begun And a hero will rise He will be the one theyll all be talking about In a thousand years or more There will be no mercy For the wounded soldiers There is nothing they can do But we will remember That their bravery Was their very last mistake From above the battle the sun shines on the dead All the native women are taking scalps from the soldiers heads There is celebration there is victory They will never fight this way again They will never live this free again What a great day to die And justice will be done And the eagle will fly When the battle has begun And a hero will rise He will be the one theyll all be talking about In a thousand years or more What a great day to die And justice will be done And the eagle will fly When the battle has begun And a hero will rise He will be the one theyll all be talking about In a thousand years or more

Getting closer to the gasping prey To learn the need of private war Hand in hand with rotting death Return to god in parts Without remorse Damnation on my rusty skin Curtain fire in my head Unconsciously killing all the dead Just fire and forget Abstracted deep in lust Just fell in love with guns Dont wonder You are a part of rolling thunder Rolling thunder Rolling thunder I struggled with myself When I looked into those hollow eyes Upheld that fragile honor That disappeared into the endlessness of time You are a part of rolling thunder Rolling thunder Rolling thunder I chose the path of blind dissension I never woke up when I heard the cries My everlasting hate to be revealed As kids were dying by their mothers side I earned the seed of retaliation Destroyed the fruits of human race Desensitized by blood and ichor Returning home with a bag on my face Abstracted deep in lust Just fell in love with guns Dont wonder You are a part of rolling thunder Rolling thunder Rolling thunder I struggled with myself When I looked into those hollow eyes Upheld that fragile honor That disappeared into the endlessness of time
"Fourteen minutes and fiftynine seconds into our fifteen minutes of fame When the luck runs out, I wont wonder whos to blame Because nobody said they had a guaranteed way To win the hearts of the public who are easily swayed And just this time last year, I thought we had it made We were One Hit Wonderful Livin the life, playin the role We were One Hit Wonderful Well, it cant last long They dont love you They just love that one song Well, things dont last long in life thats how it goes Theyll smile and applaud, then turn up their nose Things will shrink as quickly as theyve grown But its perfectly normal for us to ask why The company wasnt untrue, they just didnt try And a new career is born. It will eventually die We were One Hit Wonderful Livin the life, playin the role We were One Hit Wonderful Well, it cant last long They dont love you They just love that one song That one song... That one song So many lovely melodies So many messages to convey But they dont care about any of these Play that one damn song! is what they say We were One Hit Wonderful Livin the life, playin the role We were One Hit Wonderful Well, it cant last long They dont love you Oh, no! We were One Hit Wonderful Livin the life, playin the role We were One Hit Wonderful Well, it cant last long They dont love you They just love that one song"

"First Verse If I was a streetballer yall would call me Biggie Smalls In awe of the flow wouldnt wanna cough as I ball in the halls Yeah Biggie Smalls such a proper title My size little but my skills large like tidal Waves is what people do when I get on stage Love spreads longitudinal effects transverse Through speakas positivity transcends the universe I shine like the Sun, the music starburst I swear Im Apollo but my ego I swallow Because livin arrogantly will only invite sorrow So make the best of today dont worry bout tomorrow I know Ill be alright long as my heart I follow Ideas of wisdom and peace are what I borrow Learn from your pain then move on does no good to wallow Dont shy way from low points or life will be hollow Carpe diem regardless, full throttle! Chorus You know what it do as I bless the mic Best to let loose cause this songs so tight Defy those who tell you how to live your life Peace love and unity is how we fight When you see something wrong something your soul dont like Dont whine or complain stead act to make it right Be true to yourself dont get lost in the hype You know what it do as I bless the mic Second Verse Yes we were born and raised in the pit of the flame And were never gonna give that aint in our name Same ingredients so were one in the same Only thing different is how we channel our flame Most of us take life too seriously where worry reigns Dont know bout you but lifes just a really fun game Do you just get wet or do you feel the rain? Do you grab the coins or do you give away your change? Think about that real quick who gives a shit what they say Only way to break the chains is to go gainst what they call sane Make the choice are you plain or insane? Im ordinary and extraordinary like Bat Wayne In this world of negativity what is your aim? Aspire to inject positivity into this dame we know as Earth Mother of mothers who gave us birth Simple as love and peace dont complicate it with the church What they call God, Allah, Buddha, Judger of Sins Is something no further than what you find within Believin in someone elses experience is religion Livin your own is spirituality, lets begin! Chorus ... Chorus V2 Raised in the pit of the flame nothings gon top us Make the best of whatever nothings gon stop us Raised in the pit of the flame, break your chains Make the best of the present, and do it again! Raised in the pit of the flame nothings gon top us Make the best of whatever nothings gon stop us Raised in the pit of the flame, break your chains Make the best of the present, and do it again!"

"The night has come again.. Ill spread my wings with the rains.. The darkness came to me.. There is nothing to see.. The sparking candle aroused.. And chanted me to defy.. The cold shivering winds.. The earthly frosty friends.. I sparked the candle.. And turned another page.. But the pen has been fallen.. and Ive lost the words...again Lost between the letters.. Missing behind the words.. Around the cries of candles.. I lay my head to sleep... Now its fading, the feeling of the winter Now its leaving, the mourning of the cold Living..dying..dreaming..dying.. suffering..dying...screaming...dying The day has come again.. The rays are licking the rains.. The brightness came to me.. But There is nothing to see.. The sparking candle has died.. And chanted me to try.. Its fading..Its fading.."
"The boy stays still and quiet letting consequences take him Why does it matter anymore? It probably would have been better if he WAS killed. he never lived for anything other than being rich. the emptiness he felt was overwhelming Maybe he can be killed. just not the way he wants to The boy thinks of each bath salt video and article hes watched. how can reenact them? The boy stands and roars like the kid in that one video where the guys in the back of the police car on bath salts. hopefully you know what Im talking about Dude 1 and 2 wtf The boy charges Dude 1 The two wrestle for a moment until The Boy goes full out in his character and begins biting into his neck after laughing hysterically Dude 2 is this bitch on bath salts!? WHEN DID THIS MOTHERFUCKER DO BATHSALTS!? In these moments the boy wishes he spent his life experimenting with drugs instead. maybe he wouldnt have died so empty. itd be so much better dying doing something you love. maybe he really is on drugs Theres a loud bang Maybe its back up bursting through the door The boy feels a weird feeling in his skull A warm liquid runs down his face The boy tries to smile but his body couldnt exactly handle it all... The boy sees nothing but a bright flash Suddenly the boy hears Rick Ross verse of U.O.E.N.O A large silhouette appears before the boy The boy I guess Im dead... [Happy face emoticon] Father Hi dead, Im dad THE END"

"A year after his last words were circulated throughout the land, the 13th Dalai Lama died. According to custom, his body was embalmed, dressed in gold brocade robes, placed in the lotus position and seated facing south the direction of long life...Checking the Dalai Lamas corpse one morning, attendant monks entered its sealed chamber and found that the head had moved. No longer facing south, it had turned towards the northeast. Repositioned, it was again discovered facing east. In the ensuing months further signs appeared. Being left soulabandoned, facing south As a new born one Seeds o compassion, shall be found The oracles trance told mystical signs Incarnations quest Leading towards the rising sun To the lake of visions For answers, they will seek Staring peacefully Omens through the waters Amongst majestic peaks Letters, clearly seen AhKaMa Auspicious journey Foreshadowed signs revealed Guiding prophetically Omens, to be answered A young child, they will meet Chosen, shall he be? To the lake of visions For answers, they will seek Staring peacefully Omens, to be answered A young child, they will meet Chosen, shall he be?"

Forgotten call What shadows lie ahead Ringing bells Why am I in tears Breath of the past Summon heroes of the tales That guarded us from dark and fears Deep inside We still believe in wonder But the world around Turns our hearts to stone Words of lies Are bringing us to madness How long can it go on Peoples souls are asleep Time to survive Theres no time to weep For whats left behind We have to be strong Shake of dirt and lies Or how could you look Into your own childrens eyes Mother Russia I see you bleeding but sleeping why?

"All passenger prepare the game ritual There once was a man on this train, he was born into this world alone Hands never laid on the wheel, content, he will never know more He was a quiet man in pain, his tears I fear are closing in again What you lose in years you again in perspective And the passenger pauses to see his mistakes For with nothing to follow hed lived all his life in vain But then, who here among us is without shame? His way was divergent and cold, defaced, this mask he must create And the circle unfolding still, unscathed, he will turn a blind eye He will miss the last train home this day, recycled in the flow reborn again The cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing And the passenger pauses to see his mistakes For with nothing to follow hed let all his will decay But then, true wisdom comes in learning pain And I have known pain And the passenger pauses to see his mistakes For with nothing to follow hed lived all his life in vain But then, the lesson unlearned he will begin again."

"By the window you stand palisaded and dressed in grief... You where beloved in a heartfelt way. Mourning a lengthening day, my eyes in tears. A heart full of disbelief... Forever gone... Left in this place, while a sunbeam through the window alters my face. No chance in taking my pain. The seeds of the weeping willow are being sown inside of me. A timeless mourn... day and night. Outside the window, life is smiling at me. It bids me out, wished it could ease the pain over... my lost life. Why? Im gonna travel the Tabors back in hope to find my soul, above her head. Jade are my feet from walking. This, a forlorn quest. Tabor is a myth like others. Disillusioned I return homewards... Lonely as I am. Homewards the grass grows green, surrounded by flowers in bloom. A consuming jaundice comes my way... My heart is torn. At last, my spirit and I romance about the past. We have been rejoined...! Today, well walk over a bed of French rye, for I have planted back the seeds of the weeping willow in the earth again. We are together now.... No more dwelling in a burden of pain!"
"I hear the voice from nowhere Message from above keep your purity, and the queen appears Getting through this twisted world Ive put away my purity I reliaze im all alone In this desolate scene Out in the cold Standing alone Where are you now? I get closer But you keep in distance The queen wore mystic purple Gold ashes fall The queen wore mystic purple Silver rains falls The queen wore mystic purple She knows all of me Save me and Take me now Pleasa raise me up To the sky White wings turned into gray And fell out slowly Im getting weakened Losing control I was captured in the cage But she saved me Bleeding her holy blood"

"[Verse 1 MC Frontalot] I wasnt the smartest boy in the household by a longshot I knew of wandering the graveyard that its best met with an onslaught Of something called shudders Its when your body trembles and your heart skips, sputters And you mutter counterevils, and you grip on to your charms Ive never comprehended the alarm Caused by things described variously as scary Terrifying, ghastly. Could I follow this? Barely Certainly never felt it. Never shuddered, and my pops Sent me packing, called me bad luck kid, head full of rocks I talked so loudly of my ignorance as I roamed Complained I couldnt get frightened, and might have bemoaned That Id been disowned. A friendly hangman beckoned But I partied with his danglers, didnt shudder for a second Then I heard about a castle in the distance that was haunted Nobody lasted there an evening. Could it be just what I wanted? Didnt know [Chorus] Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of [Verse 2 MC Frontalot] I wasnt the first one to show up claiming bravery The rumored ends of my predecessors were unsavory Theyd become the catering at a feast of ghouls and spirits! Neither the king nor his people would set foot near it This seemed good fear, it glistened in their eyes as they spoke I figured I could pick the habit up and go maybe all the way back home, having understood shuddering Did the townspeople deem me a simpleton? Utterly What a first night it was, too! The hellbeasts Were like from a nightmare. I think? I dont get bad dreams I tried to nap but the furniture floated and spun We did some doughnuts in the stable yard! Fun The second nights vigilance wasnt any more fruitful Zombies down the chimney till the whole rec. rooms full Allbone ninepin, glad I brought my lathe Though I lost some money gambling, my denseness was unscathed [Chorus] Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of [Verse 3 MC Frontalot] Third and final evening, my reanimated corpse Cuddlebuddy tried to strangle me. Reliable sources Report that I chucked him back in his coffin and sighed Despaired of finding shudders locally and set to stride Didnt I want my reward? The hand of the castles princess? A path to power and riches, and this is its ingress? And this is my dimness, I guess, but I choose to keep questing Find the next hypothesis of scariness and keep testing But heres that princess requesting that I reconsider And as I spy her she reminds me of my babysitter A village girl I had a crush on as a lad Who never even noticed that I couldnt make eye contact This ones staring me down Shes used to getting her way, been wearing a crown Is she scaring me now, with her Think about it, please? I got this odd involuntary shaking in my knees [Chorus] Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of Didnt know There was anything In the world To be frightened of"

"Streets lined with stories, entwined words flow, flash, grow and fade away. Lives run on rails, crawling lights show, flash, grow and fade away. Streets in amber glow Streets in amber glow Streets in amber glow. They stare in wonder, blinded rain slows, slips, pools and flows away. Rust clings born broken, twisted cracks grow, split, fray and wear away, wear away. Dark shadows whisper, sights seen fall, rise, combine then sink below. Time fades inwards, coiled leaves still flow, flash, fade and grow away. Streets in amber glow Streets in amber glow. Streets in amber glow Streets in amber glow. Days last glow slipping away and leaving the world in shade. Shade."

[excerpt from an official Army training film, Personal Health in the Jungle] [The Buttress] I put the belladonna in the eye drops for enhanced optics Im watching the pond fronds dance in the tropics High off the trance inducement fumes arise from rocks Singing songs with the frogs in the lagoon Lost prophetess, who? Monsoon is brewing to consume you and your entire platoon When? Soon! Keep it moving Surprise, the driest of our horizon High sea rise in a bad moon Hear the voice of raging ruin Dont go back, its a trap, shes waiting there with Jak The patron saint of pain, the lady Macbeth of rap They tried with all their might but they could not deliver From out the heart of darkness, Buttress and Jak Tripper May you live forever. It really isnt tough to stay on your feet in the jungle. Youve got the best weapons in the world.

"Inside me anger builds like a blaze from below Mindlessness causing this that is out of control Inferior are the thoughts and ideas which you think For the light at the end of your tunnel is to late Do not taint the ground in which I walk on Do not defile, the air in which I intake For you and your cortege are disillusioned Disciples of this dreadful epidemic The intellectual has no meaning, as I lay silently screaming for those of simplicity to awake and reach for the edge that I take Looking down up from this tower, I watch those shake and cower The time shall come and none to soon, when all the frail shall meet their doom Let the weak play with weak, let the skilled be by skilled Let the sounds that are clear soak in and be filled, In the heads and the hearts of the ones that are true Like the moon in the sky it will surely shine through Do not taint the ground in which I walk on Do not defile, the air in which I intake For you and your cortege are disillusioned Disciples of this dreadful epidemic"
Ones your souls at rest Thats when youll cofess Cut you down to size Make you realize That you not so tough Say youve had enough What it takes to learn On the cross youll burn You must respect the dead Thats where your future lies You must respect the dead Or theyll rip out your eyes When you in your tomb You will meet with doom Cause youve cursed the dead Better left unsaid Youll regret the days That youve spit on graves Now your time has come You immortal scum

"[Verse 1 Justin Stone] They said I should branch out, here I am Breaking through the ceiling Writing this I felt uncomfortable, but crazy, here I am If money talks, Id let my wallet talk forever I guess Im happy now, honestly I could be better But Ill talk about it later, I gotta picture to paint Ive got my ego raging, but my feelings just deflate Everything Im not is everything that I became They like to talk me down, I just like to put them in their place Its a race to the finish, havent stopped once This feeling of new heights makes me high without blunts Im fly, who are they to tell me that I cant stunt? Cause I started in my basement with a hundred dollar mic Now its like I go out and they think Im someone famous And its crazy when I hear them say that I am going places DJ, play that back, somebody tell me that again I just want you to be proud of every single thing I am [Chorus Justin Stone] This world is coming to the end Drop a gun, why dont you pick up the pen? Saying we could come together Saying we could come together All you hear is lies on the radio They wont play real music, but here we go It could change if we all come together Say if we all come together [Verse 2 Abstract] When I was young, I used to scheme, Im breaking in the industry Trippin up myself, trying to match my idols chemistry Suffocating my own energy just to fit the mold But acting like you Midas dont mean your touch gon be gold Some dance in the fire, some thrive in the cold Some find wisdom in letting go, some through finding the hold Some find worth in their products, some through consuming whats sold Either working behind the curtain, the yellow bricks, and the road Sell a story, sell who we are This is entertainment, selfmade reality stars Some hide selfinterest behind the music Some hide the music behind their selfinterest Everybody screaming, Spotlight, Im more important! Hes not worthy, and she dont deserve it His reality dont match mine, he aint real How could his opinion ever differ from how I feel Sarcasm [Chorus Justin Stone CTrox] This world is coming to the end Drop a gun, why dont you pick up the pen? Saying we could come together Saying we could come together All you hear is lies on the radio They wont play real music, but here we go It could change if we all come together yeah Say if we all come together its your boy CTrox [Verse 3 CTrox] If we all come together, we can fix whats broke Yeah, Im talking bout record labels and managers Cause they all steal the most They want me now cause Im sittin low Should I be thinkin out loud through my music with a deal thats closed? Focus on progression, I dont need to sign that dotted line I know that Im up next, but dont call me up, its not worth my time All the offers mean stress, I dont need to impress But I know that you wont believe me whats been on my mind Its a world with no image, I dont mean to be rude But the majority of famous rappers are just good looking dudes With no talent, no voice, no verses with a story No passion, no drive to do anything but make money I hate it, but the fans wont change it, its no debate So yall get left with is average music words every day Ive got the drive to keep going, so listen to what I make Appeal to all the regular people, I hope that you can relate Can relate [Chorus Justin Stone] This world is coming to the end Drop a gun, why dont you pick up the pen? Saying we could come together Saying we could come together All you hear is lies on the radio They wont play real music, but here we go It could change if we all come together Say if we all come together"

Poor sons and fathers Burdening one another With compassion felt by few Kings of plenty take their lives With wars of the dying youth Comrades falling piling high As they lay in ruins Bury me alive Deep inside a tomb Carry out your life Dying by her side Snakes of three The son stands alone In the empire having nothing left to lose Daughters wives become the bribes And then he faces the awful truth And then he faces the awful truth I am buried alive with his bride Out of the grey stones These snakes will eat leaves of life One by one they come through breathing life Hunger creeps on him yet he never yields Ignorant and young a son cuts eyes to tail Death in hand Death in time Death of flesh but not of mind

"Can you answer what love is? Cause some have no idea,you may say you know what love is but in reality your clueless in your soul.You have never known what love is and may never figure it out for yourself.Word to the wise if someone can give you advice on what love is then you should listen to what they say.You can feel the passion that some cant you just need to realize what your feeling and you should listen to what you feel and never forget what you feel or what you felt cause it may go away but it will all come back.If you never feel this void you may have at one point then you will never get rid of the void.If you know what love is your one lucky person and you need to figure out if your love is as strong as death if it is your love is as strong with the spirit as the feeling for another"

"The first attempts at contact employed special electronic devices that transformed stimuli sent in both directions. The ocean played an active part in the design of the devices though all this happened in complete darkness. It modified certain components of the equipment lowered into it, as a result of which the discharges it registered would change, and the devices would record a multitude of signals that were like fragments of some vast advanced analysis. In fact, certain results were obtained. The oceana source of electrical, magnetic, and gravitational impulsesspoke as it were in the language of mathematics certain sequences of its electrical discharges could be classified by drawing on the most abstract branches of terrestrial analysis and of set theory they contained homologues of structures known from the area of physics that is concerned with the mutual relationship between energy and matter, finite and infinite magnitude, particles and fields. All this led scientists to believe they were dealing with a thinking monster, that it was some kind of protoplasmic sealikebrain grown so vast it covered an entire planet, which passed time engrossed in theoretical reflections on an inconceivable scale concerning the nature of the universe and that what the instruments captured were no more than tiny, accidentally overheard snippets of a stupendous monologue, utterly beyond our comprehension, that was endlessly being performed in its depths."

Fuck your make shift label Cause you still aint bringin shit to the table I keep it real, your shits all fable Never did I think that I would be able To write lines, that blow minds Ya new flows my old grind So what makes you think you compare to me Though I show you up so embarrassingly It must be a mystery, simply I put phrases in rhythm to make a simile Yall put hate on Facebook to try to get into me In this industry your friends become your enemys But there will be no end to me Only the real fans recognize my legacy"

So I sneaked back and caught her with my man, Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor, Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve She told me more about me than I knew myself Jukka Jokikokko Bass Jussi Ontero Drums Jari Tiura Vocals Marco Sneck Keyboards Pete Ahonen Guitars, Vocals backing"

"Let the blood spill, between my broken teeth The desert landscapes stretch on the infinite horizon Monotonous and wild Unchain the wrath, naked skin tries to stay closed Under the atrocious lashing sounds Step by step appear the lugubrious furrows Drawn by the born rivers Their streams dig again and again, corrode the ground Torturing the wide expanses The sky turns black, the surfaces become quivering The fleshy mountains like alive proudly rise Cut in their middle, pierced under the rock Opening the labyrinths of human thoughts Lacerated plains by barbaric passages Underground flows and plaintive whispers Floods and earthquakes Lightning strikes, traumatizes and signs the eternity with a forgotten name Beneath a blinding light A blinding light The ground separates, cut in several places The imprint of hostile elements is close to be made Break I clench my jaws and I bite as strong as I can I let the blood spill between my broken teeth Lava currents drown The fissures And spread the running disease Hidden under indelible scars Damages are made of a delicious disharmony Like a bow sliding at random on a out of tune violin Shapeless and devastating magmas search for the path of the surface Fighting hopeless not to be broken The desert landscapes stretch on the infinite horizon Monotonous and wild Unchain the wrath, naked skin tries to stay closed Under the atrocious lashes Lava currents drown The fissures And spread the running disease Hidden under indelible scars"

Ive been searching for the peace in my mind Its nowhere to be found. Your soul with me Resting under my skin. I see no point of living the life I lead It hurts me too much. Can you feel what I feel? It must go deep. My own soul is my enemy. It seems like everything I do just crashes down It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal. Broken promises now run through my head I cant see the future and it all turns black. Whats the point of being here When this whole life is dragging me down? Is this how well be? I dont want to be part of it. It must go deep. My own soul is my enemy. It seems like everything I do just crashes down It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal. Broken promises now run through my head I cant see the future. It all turns black. If theres another way You can live another day Then youll know just when pressures getting stronger. I can hear voices calling my name I guess they are over my head. It seems like everything I do just crashes down It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal. Broken promises now run through my head

"Sickened by this apathy The problems sit in front of our eyes, but we do not see We turn our backs to where the solutions lie Destroy all that gives us life Left it for dead, we will soon follow No future, no tomorrow Mankinds natural regression toward selfdestruction The sky bleeds as the wound becomes infected The end of a world neglected Sift through the ashes Ignored the signs cries Stripped away all that gives us our basic needs We have already planted the seeds of destruction Suffocate us for the price of corporations greed RECORDED MIXED IN ONE DAY THE JAM ROOM BY JAY FEBRUARY 1999 PRODUCED BY FROM HERE ON MASTERED BY JOHN GARDNER PARALLAX AUDIO POST 2000 REMASTERED BY JAMIE KING BASEMENT STUDIOS 2005 LAYOUT DESIGN BY CARSON SLOVAK WWW.CARSONSLOVAK.COM FROM HERE ON WAS OWEN ORTMAYER BASS DAVID THREATT GUITAR TOMMY ROGERS VOCALS CHRIS RUBENSTEIN VOCALS MATT BAGWELL GUITAR ROB JOHNSON DRUMS MUSIC FHO LYRICS TOMMY ROGERSCHRIS RUBENSTEIN FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM HERE ON WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR FRIENDS, FAMILIES, FANS AND ALL OF THE BANDS"
"The seemingly endless journey takes its toll on his soul But in the darkest hours his fathers spirit walks beside him Whispers of the past and the time to come Encouraging, scaring and forces him to press on Standing at the gates that leads me to your heart Will you open it, or close it forever? The key is in your mind, remember where it lies And Ill be there beside you when you open up your eyes Running out of time, lost inside the void Falling deep, to eternal sleep Running in the dark, on a road that is unmarked Seek the light, we must survive And make it out alive The fire in my heart burns forever Nothing in this world will tear this apart The truth in your voice cries like thunder Together for this final fight In Unity we ride through the night Walking down the path that takes me straight in to your mind Where the memories we shared lives forever Clouded is your sight, it comes as no surprise For the enemy has poisoned the air with his lies Trust me with your life, open up your eyes Remember now, spread your wings and fly Right here by your side is no need to hide Brace yourself for this final fight Our world must survive The fire in my heart burns forever Nothing in this world will tear this apart The truth in your voice cries like thunder Together for this final fight In Unity we ride through the night Standing all alone Looking in to your eyes as life fades away What will I become when there is no one left to die for? Is this the end for us my friend or will we meet again?"

"A young girls eyes are filled with pain She suffers from years of guilt and shame She sleeps at night afraid of the dark You know she fears always the tapping of daddys knock He says hes there to love her Hell only do whats best and right And then he starts to hold her He touches her skin, she prays for redemption Nobody sees behind her smile Nobody hears the screams of a wounded child Her secret burns inside her soul You know she quit fighting and built her heart of stone Another night is closing She hears his footsteps at the door His passion hungry for her A fire so hot, it shattered her innocence Take my burning hands I want redemption Show me who I am Give me redemption Help me to understand God, help me find my redemption Her daddy smells of smoke and gin A prisoner of the lust that feed within And mothers face is black and bruised A lonely broken victim of daddys rule And when the world is sleeping A voice is heard in deep despair The sound of endless weeping A desolate child whose sanitys questioned Take my burning hands I want redemption Show me who I am Give me redemption Help me to understand God, help me find my redemption Give me redemption Well, I need redemption, oh, yeah Redemption A young girls eyes are filled with pain She suffers, forever her life is changed Take my burning hands I want redemption Show me who I am Give me redemption Help me to understand God, help me find my redemption Take my burning hands Well, I want redemption Show me who I am Give me redemption Help me to understand God, help me find my redemption Redemption My redemption"
"I just close my eyes, and wait until the very end To face this dreadful day Hiding in this room and submerged by the glowing dawn I can feel but regrets I wish I could change it all, all the mistakes Ive made But I cant just forget the bitter taste of shame I wish I were strong enough to deaden all the pain Yet I can but descend and consume in despair In the cold light In the cold light of the day In the cold light In the cold light of the day my life is such a letdown In the cold light In the cold light In the cold light of the day"
"Im laying a puzzle in my head. But the pieces are created by me Sometimes I wish the activity was dead. Too many hours alone. You say you love me and i know I know its true. But my dark mind, makes up its own truth It gives me fragments. Of something I might want to see. The trust invested is in danger. but only because of me! My paranoid mind is being strong I am betraying myself My dark mind gives me fragments. Of something I dont want to see. But deep down I know That its just lies! My dark mind In my dark mind In my dark my, yeeeaaah My dark mind In my mind My dark mind is changing I have hit the wall, what can I do? Which will be the weapons To kill my own dark mind."

"Its been million years and yet this bulb is my shelter. Hardly had I opened my eyes I joined their ranks Colors are faded away, sounds suspend in delay. Hey, mother, tell me Where is my home?! I dont belong to this race, Nor to this planet, Nor to this galaxy! Here bottomless greed dances with Eternal stupidity! They upgrade, they descend every hour. A mother gives birth to her child to selfdevour. Any beat of life, a sparkle of spirit they seem to hate. As soon as beauty is born They discriminate! And no respect to their race, Nor to this planet, Nor to this galaxy! And no desire to uproot their greed And eternal stupidity And invincible ignorance! Intolerable arrogance Am I floating down the river of insanity Or becoming just another part of you? Ill return, Ill come home where they wait for me, Where the nature reins the life but not you. This time we trade our lives To experience the brand new world, To realize how wrong weve been all these years, How many wonders we could behold."

The boy And the dog running after them As if after a rooster With its head chopped off"

"[Verse 1 AMS] A life in epistolary, trap an existence in words A life story between the lines, follow the details of the curves Every inkblot donates to intricacies untold The frayed edges of the notebook, and how easy the paper folds The scratched and erased, the lifespan, probably what its seen The ink fingertips that traced and dogeared pages, making the edges unclean The scars and imperfections seem simple on the surface But every mark and singular speck serves a significant purpose Cognizant of only myself the stray noise I could hear The soft static of pen against paper, and the speech that reached my ears The space between inspirations was just the wide rule of a line My ranges were infinite, lying between divine and D Minor Nine An addiction to ballpoint pens, inject upon a daily round Carrying blanks with in case something came disguised as profound The hands ached, the surroundings and purpose changed Leather bound journals became napkins in restaurants, but the drive was still the same I dined upon jazz records, and digested the inspirations But suffered stomaches if I hadnt fulfilled the postlistening obligation Sip the record skips, and drain the rest to use as ink Absorb the stereo crackle of vinyl platter, and pushing myself to the brink Breathe deeply and exhale scrawls onto a page Falling off of my margins, and straight into a state enraged Attempt to chisel writers block, back into tabula rosa A long journey to arrive back at the same line I was supposed to Plagued by papyrus, reject the typecasted elite Because Id rather scratch out lines, instead of hitting keys to delete Rejoice when a manuscript is complete, consider the end product blessed But never resting on the laurels, turn the page, and start fresh [Verse 2 AMS] Around About Midnight, I drank the last bottle of Bitches Brew Contemplating A Love Supreme, left me feeling Kind of Blue To snap my mind from the Blue Haze, I scribbled Sketches of Spain Spent the detail on the Birds of Paradise I saw from my windowpane Spoke on paper In a Silent Way, Explorations of better days The Undercurrents of my Tijuana Mood describes my Interplay Sundays at The Village Vanguard, and evenings at Birdland Drifting in and out of listening watching Porgy and Bess hold hands Naima said I was living my Life on Mars Hallucinations of Bamboo Children hanging outside of campus bars Stood under the rusted street lamps of yet another Iron City That was father to The Birth of Cool, but still shows no pity Tip my Porkpie Hat to my forefathers, inspirational kings Who pushed me to wirebound and wide rule, A Few of My Favorite Things Put the needle to the groove, mindset at 33 rotations And attach ballpoint to Mead surface, riding along the improvisations The simplest of substances, with the greatest potential Less than centimeters thick, but having the power to trap instrumentals From phone number to phoneme, chicken scratch to magnum opus Oral hocuspocus, smoking focus, just to make the dopest A paper planet with syllables written on each scrap side Would leave a lifetime of turning pages, looking for sentences inside Constrained only by time and the stanzas composed Letting the instruments fade to nothing, as I let the notebook close"

"Verse 1 Now before i start with the realest facts, i need you to listen, this world had offered me a full life, and i couldnt miss it. Id ignore you when i went out at night, youd start tripping, you reminded me of our high school nights, man was i different. Now i didnt say that i needed more, but im not saying that its not true, high school times and varsity, had me changing out the blue. The Kea you knew had a plate of food and plenty of babies with you, but all theses dreams had me thinking you came just a lil too soon. So i wondered about you, even wrote a song about you, cause those who fail at love will praise you and those who win will doubt you, but what did they know about us, we have a mountain of trust, i have plans to go over seas, and you wanna come with us, and i couldnt believe it, didnt precive it, having you was an achievement, i told you about all the doubts i had and you said boy you can achieve it. Dont think about it too much, it gets heavy when i talk us, all those flames of burning love, are the ones that had burnt us. When my brothers heard about the breakup the turnt up and came through, sat me down across the room , man tell me this aint true, that lady was youre pride and joy man this aint how we do, she, she may as well have been dating herself and this aint even bout you Verse 2 So he poured up one round for us and i dived in for six more, told me man lets walk it off and i couldnt even reach the door, i cant believe i ended things, i hear the pain as it rings , music has me moving and she said you, i cant bring, so six divided by two, no me without you, voices in the back have me saying what the fuck did i just do, but dammit we need to grow, we were moving way to slow, success aint easy as it seems and ive gotta sit front row. So mayb il miss you, mayb i dont need to, mayb il grow into the person i wanna be and the come meet you. Mayb youll marry Celbi and youll sit and watch me on tv. Mayb after this song youll pick up the phone and say i need you, but your young black beautiful, i cant deny you its true, all those crazy times, wouldnt be the same if it werent you. Youll be a CA one day while i think about you on tour, this one is my realest yet from my heart to your"

You know that we belong In a presidential suite Armed guards in the street Waving back at crowds who greet And when I look over Over my shoulder I cant see my past It seems so far away What makes you think that We belong in a presidential suite Armed guards in the street Waving back at crowds who greet Yes indeed You know that when we met There were fireworks in the sky Sparkling like dragonflies Spelling All bad folk must die And when I look over Over my shoulder I cant see my past It seems so far away It seems so far away Far away"

Theres no answer Only silence Emptiness spreading out The calm before the storm Birds dont fly We know why Do you realize the writtings on the wall? A million visions let us believe in a better future world Daring thoughts of genious minds let our hope still burn Opinions were bought To dispell our thoughts Money is oue idol Our greed for more And I see the childrens dancing and I llok in to their eyes How could they know today that their future is a lie Singing ah... wings of freedom fight singing ah... Singing ah... wings of freedom fight Singing ah... Spreading out their might Singing ah... The voice of reason Dies away Is there anybody there Who takes heart Busy living No misgiving Will our world colapse like a house of cards? Singing ah... the wings of freedom fight Singing ah... spreading out their might Singing ah... sow the wind and reap the storm Let a fire burn theres no return And dont give up at all Let a fire burn theres no return And dont give up at all
"Alone at night I feel so strange I need to find All the answers to my dreams When I sleep at night I hear the cries What does this mean? I shut the door and traveled to another home I met an older man, he seemed to be alone I felt that I could trust him He talked to me that night Lad did you know a girl was murdered here? This fatal tragedy was talked about for years Victorias gone forever Only memories remain She passed away She was so young Without love Without truth There can be no turning back Without faith Without hope There can be no peace of mind As the night went on I started to find my way I learned about a tragedy A mystery still today I tried to get more answers But he said, Youre on your own Then he turned away and left me As I stand there all alone He said, Youll know the truth As your future days unfold Without love Without truth There can be no turning back Without faith Without hope There can be no peace of mind Now its time to see how you died. Remember that death is not the end but only a transition."
"Tell me whats on your mind what can you feel? Recall transcending times, get so real Reaching voices guided far away Through pitch blackness to the dawn of new days Questions left unanswered often wondered why Looking at this world through transparent eyes Search through memories that didnt care I hear laughter give its one last stare So tell me where we are? And how we came so far Awake me from this dream"
"An endless Universe, that endless time has grown Formed by the hands of extinct Gods A line up of moments, a static sequence of seconds Untouchable by mankind Time the thread for the carpet of the three nornes Time constantly leading to our sudden ending I wish for an endless moment Filled with tears of joy or of pain Something to tell me I am real Something to show me Im alive A stagnation of motion, experience the uniqueness And all formed by the strength of my soul The amalgamation of future and past, the extinction of present Being lost in eternity Time an inexplicable phenomen for human mind Time genuine foundation for our lives The indifference of days causes depression The restless passing of hours causes obsession I wish for an endless moment Filled with tears of joy or of pain Something to tell me I am real Something to show me Im alive The growing requirement for a break fills my soul The desire for refreshing sleep fills my heart Let time stand still Let time stand still Let time stand still Let time stand still"

Like damn, no more homies by my side? No more happenings of anything, and I broke down despite I know I said it was forever until the day that we died But I never thought youd be the reason wed have to fight to survive But everybody gathered, and they all stood by our side And thats the reason were never leaving what theyve designed Something even greater than anything you can find And down here is the only place it survives [Hook] x2 [Verse 5 Jamie Madrox] Down here we sing of dark things, the other side of normal Dressed for death in suit and ties bitches, keep it formal Sleep the night away in caskets and graves And awaken from their slumber each And every time the song plays You see us crawling from the ground like a Romero flick Contaminating up the top side, we stay sick There is no cure or vaccine so they quarantine Our inner being and label each and all of us the enemy [Hook] x2"

"Trying to separate the outside from the inside Trying to remain calm, though they mix in subtle manner Chaos inside, losing all hope, basking in pain that seems endless Alone in this life and its futile signs of malignant forms Silent hatred for nothing, weakened for everything Gloom is no more the same, light increases the pain in this suffering Feelings have shriveled to death, awaiting to die with no idolatry Believing in nothing at all These bleeding veins are as indifferent as existence in itself No sorrow behind these wounds, just hatred and pain Reaching the end for good I might as well just sleep and awake no more to watch the dilapidation of all I might as well just dream there would be a life instead of growing nothingness Who told you that I wouldnt come back to you I am inside and growing, destroying your mind and your worthless dreams Corrupting your senses, erasing the reason and all thats left of you You cant escape for Ive become you forevermore! The sight is darkening and chaos reigns in here Theres no more explanations for this seems like the end All your precious memories and wishes are gone The swirl of damnation furls you to this nightmare Touching the cosmic horror beyond the space and time Reaching for inhuman experience, the journey to afar The limits of mind are gone, hallucinating the death of the universe Vortex of chaos and hell leaves only ash and dust There was none to witness the death of a man who saw it all coming"

I gave back the tshirt that youd always wear I went by your work just left it there All the leaves are brown its autumn now It was a summer fling Dont take it personal or anything You can wear your heart on your sleeve But pull your sweater over No more kisses under shooting stars No more rides on the handlebars No more driveins In the back seat of your parents car It was a summer fling it didnt mean anything you can cry your eyes out on the phone Oh yeah
"Cry with my tears Cry with my pain Still in the cold Neverending rain With one of your kisses My words youd freeze From one of your kisses My bleeding would cease Shed all my tears The flood devours all The earth, us, rushing... A shy, whispered call Death becomes angels Who wont turn away Defying all my yearing And my body of clay Cry with my crying You end up like a mole Death loves the angels Retired into my soul As Im drained and welken My last wish I sigh Let me be, darling Tears in your eye."

Right now, I feel as if Im not even livin Moment to moment in constant anticipation Struggling to get through every single situation Ill take the advice, you gave to better my life Because now more than ever, its time for us to fight This is real life stuff, well all go through Im just lucky this time, somehow my Moms pulled through [Chorus 2X] [Verse 2 Cale Sampson] My greatest challenge was almost losing my Mom Preparing myself for her to be physically gone What was I to do, my only choice was to face it Even if I run, theres no way I can escape it So whatever happens next, Ill have to try to deal The chances of her death are appearing very real Never seen someone in so much agony or pain Pushed to the very brink of what a human can withstain Such a close call in that hospital hall When you were unattented to, I had to scream out a call And sprint for a doctor, you were losing air quick Shaking uncontrollably, I really thought that was it And a group of surgeons realized they had to operate Immediately cuz the situation couldnt wait Transferred you to O.R., so they could cut your stomach open And stop that disease from destroying vital organs I remember telling you, our souls will stay connected Its no coincidence in this life theyve intersected No matter the outcome, Im a spread good energy That youve given to me Ma, I wont let fear get the best of me So dont be afraid, theres other people out there Thinking of you right now, transmitting their care You said, see ya soon Cays! then got wheeled away Showed so much bravery, I sensed youd be okay because [Chorus 2X]"

"He thinks in a magazine, he found it all Wrote the article in sharpie, on his wall So everyday he wakes up, he jumps up so tall Saw the magazine, thought he couldnt seem small Felt like heaven in the clouds gave him a call Loved him, and his words even the flaws On the cover of it, was a girl... For her, hed search the whole world Which was on page eleven of the magazine Rewinds and reminds him of a certain dream Like it was out of a movie screen Its like happiness, it would seem He was happiest, in between Dreams But then he screams For some real powerful words to say And he ran to the depths of the bay Down by the bay, water would play A soft song, carried on through the day There he sits near the boats away From the world, there the mag lays Beside him, inside him is stray Magazine today had nothing to say Except the same out things, movie screen Same old pages with beauty queen He wasnt sure why but when he read it He thought he could fly, now to forget it All he said is, whats already in his head Goodbye to what he already read And he picked up that ripped magazine Read every line and letter in between Searched every single line for words he loved Finished it then looked for the skies above Found the sun, then he found the wind Blowing at him just to begin With the rest of his life...moving farther He tossed that magazine in the water And he let it go When can I let you go? Left by the bay...."

"When I was just a little wide eyed child Trying to beat the heat I saw that cool clear water running in the creek I climbed up on the highest branch in a tall pine tree I closed my eyes and held my breath And I heard my mama call to me She said you better look before you leap You might find yourself in way too deep There may be danger that you cant see You better look before you leap Later on, I was growing up Talking to my best friend I told her I had kissed a boy And I wanted to do it again She said, lets go see my big sister Maybe she can talk some sense Shes in a world of trouble And shes the voice of experience Her sister told us look before you leap You might find yourself in way too deep There may be danger that you cant see You better look before you leap Chances will be taken Its easy to go too far The more you think about it The better off you are Now someones coming with a proposition And I think I smell a rat I say wait a minute mister I want to think about that I take a little time to listen To the voices inside my head Its my mama and my best friends sister And I remember what it was they said They said you better look before you leap You might find yourself in way too deep There may be danger that you cant see You better look before you leap"

From the red dust north of Dalmore Downs Sharmans tents roll into town Twelve will face the auctioneer Sharmans Boxers stand their ground Their days are darker than your nights But they wont be the first to fall Children broken from their dreams But they wont be the first to fall Fighting in the spotlight Eyes turn blacker than their skin For Jimmy Sharmans boxers Its no better if you win Standing in the darkness Lined up waiting for the bell The days are wasted drinking At the first and last hotel Why are we fighting for this? Why are you paying for this? You pay to see me fall like shrapnel To the floor What is the reason for this? There is a reason for this? What is the reason they keep coming back for more? The blows now bring him to his knees But still the crowd calls out for more The drums are burning in his ears The man keeps counting out the score HirstMoginie
"[Verse 1 Pharoahe Monch] I stand here before the forces of evil with a style The poetically Godgifted child Bringin forth the story of a lyrical soldier Blessed to manifest in the eyes of the beholder Words of wisdom never abuse the lines They increase, as I release a phrase like a UZI 9 From the larynx Shot in repetition, words never heard before But still the rendition of rap will enable me to attack From dawn to dusk for liberation Driven I will never give in to interrogation The rank, given to me, the Pharoahe Cause every blow flows like a crossbow Equipped to pierce your soul with a poisontip arrow Any man wearing a blindfold can be misled But wise are the ones with the eyes in the backs of the head Heres the key to unlock the door Imagine a poet without poetical flaw Rhymes are for sure as an attack Cause they adapt to combat for the prisoners of war [Verse 2 Prince Poetry] I drop, smash and cause a damage equivalent to a hydrogen bomb Raidin villages like a poetical soldier in Vietnam Poetry releasin deadly gasses Bodies deteriorating as they stalk past the fatal acids As a rebel of rap, I stop Load the Luger as I maneuver with precaution As I verbally counterattack Striking like a mad sniper cause Im the type of hyperactive viper To wipe away the enemy with no remedy Cause Im the epitome, so dont try to get rid of me You little ittybitty twentyfive automatic, youre killin me Cause Im a Glock 9 that will rock your mind, distortin it Shorten your brainwaves As the rhyme intertwine with the sign of the times Dont sleep cause I creep attackin from the side that is blind Therefore, I gotta be hard to the core And I walk as a prisoner of war [Verse 3 Pharoahe Monch] Wake up to the mathematics of an erratic rap Rejuvenator of rhyme, that sort of come automatic Poetical medical medicine for the cerebellum I divert em and flirt em, insert em then I repel em A breakdown, poetical shakedown Fiftytwo pickup a stickup so get on the floor facedown The ammo to keep the people steppin Breakin open the vault because Im like a verbal assault weapon Im mathematical, acrobatical Attack the wack, take rap to the maximum Youre strung out, youre hung out when you heard the style that I brung out of thin air Must come out my mouth where I stick my tongue out in the atmosphere Take a good look at whats happening here On the microphone, Im rappin Pickin em, stickin em up Breakin em, shakin em up and bashin The lyric dictator, the aviator of antonym All beware to prepare for the guillotine Rhymes go express, expert, extreme Be up to par with wisdom and intellect Detaching ones head directly from ones neck Still Ive been illing and drilling your brain Like a villain I came in the darkness to spark the literature for sure When I rhyme for the prisoners of war [Verse 4 Prince Poetry] There is strength in my mentalbolism Brains to spare upon info, knowledge, data Greater aspects affects my future environment So in the event I drop science to suit ya, uproot ya Hunt ya down Verbally attackin from the ground up to intellectually shoot ya Lurkin through the shadows of darkness, shots fired The spark hits the trees, releasin lyrical ammo While I camouflage in the flash of my stature Mentally cease MCs that be surrounded, I capture Enemy lines are crushed, bumrushed And plus your government officials are corrupted cause theyre down with us Poetical rebels on a rampage of wrecked dialects Blown lyric projects Heat is scopin you through my infrared twentytwenty scope lens Steppin upon base thats when the Organized Konfusion massacre begins with a blast Never will an intruder approach cause they will never ever last Cause the task is total termination Poetry and the Pharoahe starts as the revelation"

All she needs Is a little of affection And a bit of understanding And shell be just fine All she needs Is a shoulder to cry on Is a song in the morning And shell be just fine All she needs Is a paintbrush and a cigarette Naked bodies and a frame And shell be just fine All she needs Is inspiration in the morning A smoke filled room with music flowing And shell be just fine All she needs is just her mind at ease All she needs is just her mind at ease All she needs Is sometime to think about it Is a kiss on her forehead And shell be just fine All she needs Is some time with her heart Is a way to rule the world And shell be just fine All she needs is just her mind at ease All she needs is just her mind at ease All she needs is just her mind at ease All she needs is just her mind at ease

"They try to make me feel bad cause I dont wanna live in this fucked up neighborhood. Cause I refuse to deal dope to take care of my children. You know! Live how I live, its only cause Ive been through it Verse one Why is it wrong that I long for a life with no violence? Or sirens following sounds of gunshots firing? Innocent folks dying, living here grows tiresome Jobs Im qualified for froze hiring So I am just simply a product of my environment So, screw retirement, Im barely getting by with this On a wish, wing and a prayer, I wanna make this rap thing a career But its the same love ballad Ive been singing for years So my lady dont seem to care Cause the false hopes and promises, weve both seen our share But I know theres gotta be some way for me to profit more I know theres life waiting outside these projects doors When I explore my options, Im coming up short I try to vent to my friends but what the fuck for? I scream my dreams they seem less impressed with it I guess my boys are just well dressing pessimists Busy chasing estrogen, they sexually charged If destiny called they probably too lazy to check messages Dont get me wrong, I aint ashamed to be hood Understood? but itll be good if I could see less of it Less aggressiveness, way less police greetings A new neighborhood would change the way police greet us From a hey, boy to a simple hello, sir They wouldnt see me as some ignorant Negro first But nowadays Im fed up hearing my old earth Tripping cause Im in between jobs trying to soul search See Ive looking up and down but theres no work Filling applications out, dropping off resumes but even though Im too talented for that peasant pay Realistically, Im a peasant in present day Without money, I just cant afford to hesitate Plus Im hungry, trying to put us in a better place thats really what I need to do Im sick of living in an area where people wont even deliver pizza too And these security gates they break daily So my lady and my neighbors dont feel safety My homies seem complacent with wasting away Or just partying til the date they placed in a grave But even though I dont got a pot to piss in I got a mission, Im optimistic gotta drop the negative views blocking my vision Gotta pocket some quick dollars like its nobodys business Racing against the clock, feels like Im chasing the second hand Im to the point Ill take any job that you recommend forget about the fact Ive been on multiple tours Im not too highminded to work at a grocery store or any place Im employed, I got pride, dont think that mine is missing what kind of man is ashamed to make an honest living? I mean, my children got food, clothes, shelter and Imma be embarrassed? come on what kind of times you live in? where dope dealers get more respect than 9 to 5ers What kind of man would be ashamed to make an honest living? Chorus It feels like Im struggling and barely getting by The attitude around me is live and let die My boys, they just wanna get drunk and get high But I just wanna make me an honest living I just wanna make me an honest living I just wanna make me an honest living Live how I live, its only cause Ive been through it"
"All I see is shadows and night Four seasons turn into one Its a cold and dark time Fear graps a hold of me The whispers in my ears They are getting stronger all the time Moment by moment til end All sources of light has gone The last sunset is near The sky is so dark and clear Its time to end it all Ill do it all by my own The day when the sun fade away The day when all light is gone away All I feel is emptiness and fear Im fumbling in dark without a guide Theres no turning back, no return My soul is in forever burn The last sunset is near The sky is so dark and clear Its time to end it all Ill do it all by my own The day when the sun fade away The day when all light is gone away All I see is shadows and night Four seasons turn into one Its a cold and dark time Fear graps a hold of me All I know is I am dead All is done, all is said No more life in me Just leave and let me be The last sunset is near The sky is so dark and clear Its time to end, to end it all Ill do it all by my own The day when the sun fade away The day when all light is gone away"
"Jesus touched my shoulder Stay away from me Grenade in my glovebox Im gagging on your bullshit Hive of scum and villiany Touch of lice from touching kids Horsewhipped Brought up in West Carolina Next stop, Tennessee Harkened back to Hell, stigmata Only in America does Jesus Save.. Marlboro miles God loves a working man But he kills children too Dreaming in black and white You only get to die one time Revel in semen stained sheets Pelted by my memories Your winning wet tshirt dripping rich read I thought I noticed some labored breathing Your youth died in the closet that day When you forgot to say your prayers Now you know that shame starts somewhere I think youre too dumb to be this proud"
Bunger Of the unholy master Curse the light Enter the dark Breeding madness In the name of magic Ripping evil takes control Denying Jesus Christ And his useless ways Midnight chimes Angels decay Now The flesh consumed Satans legions Appear across the sky Sorcery Blackened arts Feed the devil The virgins blood
SUCH IS LIFE Yung Zombie Flow Such is life caught up in a strife Get all poetic as i grip the mic Imma tap into my mind and take flight People want to fight but i dont think thats right I travel with a heavy mind but fly light Up in the sky bouncing and weaving like a kite Like a lions bite i got a lot of might But life is nothing but a long night Such is life Im all about my grind All about watching the time as it passes by Not aiming for a life that is regular Everybody get all technical then get mad at yer I just telling you how it is dont shoot the messenger Travelling through life and Ive had a lot of passengers But they all vanish like Im committing massarces Characters turn up as life occurs Express my self through the use of words Hear the sound of nature and all the birds And still end up glorifying the curb They just fail in comparison Pail in my hand son as i climb and run up the mountain Drink out of the fountain of youth Infinite youth in the booth Im broke like a chipped tooth Never lose cruise through the winter blues Wearing everybodys shoes please save your views Your thoughts are there to amuse Life is life i win and i lose Dont glorify the fools i use the tools To break the rules cool?
"This world that we live in is a lonely place to hide, This is just the beginning of a story Im here to tell you. Ill hang this cross upside down around my neck, Forget about what you believe in, forget about everything that you stood for. All the lies confused minds fucking blind Seeking shelter under a sun, a sun that never sets Seeking shelter in a world of lies under a sun that never sets. Time will tell, if its my time I will lie down and burn under this sun, If it is my time I will burn so bright Im still pissing blood Ill give you one reason why I cannot stand the sight of you Sinking always sinking I clearly stole this line from a friend of mine Youre praying to no one because no one fucking cares Set me free Let me sun bake in hell"
"No use turning away This wave now blackening out the world Prophecy now stands in the way Future is looking down Embers rise and fall Behind this Ghoulish Wall The world now hangs in balance Truth unfolds through a dead mans eyes Pandemonium Is Now As the blood flows Every life now counts They have got to die It is one for all Though none for one Pandemonium Is Now Let the blood flow Every life you take Is one that counts Ascend to madness Alive While the blood flows Bludgeonings now second nature Blunt force, exerting the fight for survival Brave is the one that deals the blow As the blood flows Every life now counts They have got to die It is one for all To stay alive Broken, but not defeated Every fiber in your body Will burn to kill Shaken, yet undeterred Every muscle clenched To rid this Evil Rampant, Dissonant, Frenzy To bathe in the fire that consumes on all Trudge away Along the Path of Selfdestruction The fate of the brothers who will die in arms Will bathe in the fire that is Slowly, but surely Siphoning all hope now Rampant, Dissonant, Violent Frenzy The World Wakes Up to its Funeral Under the benevolence of your Gods Donning the ashes of civilizations This could be our fall It is a game that when starts Will surely end at some point You wont think twice to kill If it lets you live Were all the same Primal and Inane There is no shame If you happen to die for someone elses gain The dice is rolled The blood will flow The end is just a prelude to another You wont think twice to kill If it lets you live The Countdown Begins"
"Stepping into the void Yeah Ive been there Colder my eyes its more than I cant stand to bear So many words in my head Prisoners in my mouth Stepping to the void To the other side We are legion We are heroes When life goes on, take a breath and hit the world. All my life writing my name on the wall of shame When I want to disappear its not just for the game So many words in my head Prisoners in my mouth Stepping to the void To the other side"
Take a deep look into the centre of your eyes into the vast dark abyss of your soul Who do you see looking back at you? Searching for purpose and reason There are those amongst us who are lost Searching for a leader to follow I am at the front of the battlefields Blaze onwards... with or against me Eminent royalty pervades the blood of man Dignity and pride rule in this temple of the flesh The stars spine down the pathway igniting the flame Gazing into the illusion of reality Royal blood radiates Mystified by the rise of weakness Upon thrones that rise up high in the night Looking down at the flickering flames of evolution Castles and grand halls decorate the inner landscapes The pawns cannot fool my perceptions Those eyes that you are yours How is it that they cannot see further beyond? Deeper into the chasm of the ego Arrogant lividity claims the throne Beares of the thorncrown weak with their martyrdom delusions Riddled with puzzles and labyrinths There is no map for our own immortality Crosses hold not the foundations of thought Realitys the beast that mankind hath wrought Again I ask... do you know who you are? Lay down your shield and be slain The bloody axe is your redemption The seeds of man breed extinction Ensnare the triumphant blazing sky The search for truth begins when you die Die with me You will die with me You can cry with me Die with me again
Youre walking up with your eyes on me Its looking good but I just dont know I need a girl who can keep her head All night long You didnt came just to see the show I guess you know what you wanna see The way you smile lets me know I cant go wrong I wanna touch you I wanna feel you I wanna make you mine I wanna love you all night long I wanna be with you all night long I wanna love you all night long I wanna be with you all night long I saw you standing down by the stage Your black stockings and you see through dress Your mouth is open but I dont wanna hear you Say goodnight Youre sort of young but youre over age I dont care cause I like your style I dont know about your brain but You look all right I wanna touch you I wanna feel you I wanna make you mine I wanna love you all night long I wanna be with you all night long I wanna love you all night long I wanna be with you all night long Your mind is dirty but your hands are clean You show no class but your legs are long I know I cant stand another night On my own Hey girl would you like some wine Whats your name are you by yourself Are you the one what do you say Can I take you home I wanna touch you I wanna feel you I wanna make you mine I wanna love you all night long I wanna be with you all night long I wanna love you all night long I wanna be with you all night long

"Stare into the emptiness, That is in my eyes. Feel the cold draw you in. Plummet into the void I walk upon your earth, Yet I am not here. I see your wretched existence, Yet I feel nothing A moribund soul, Trapped in mortal flesh. I am among you, Yet I am lifeless. Ive felt your scorn Youve attacked me and tried to break me. Your chains have tried to bind me Wounded so many times, That now I feel no pain. My body an empty vessel, Devoid of what you call a soul Why should I fear the Hell that you speak of when it fills the emptiness left by my dying essence A moribund soul trapped in mortal flesh, I am among you yet I am lifeless Do you dare to know, The contempt that festers, The disgust that storms, In these internal chasms, How can one with no heart, Feel what you call love Detached from the pettiness of your miserable cycle, Breeding, wasting, perishing. A swarm of filthy insects. In time Ive come to learn that my humanity was a necessary sacrifice In order to be granted the greater wisdom, I am towering over your weakness, You crawl so far below, Cower as my ironclad spite descends to crush A moribund soul, Trapped in mortal flesh. I am among you, Yet I am lifeless"

"When they begin the beguine It brings back the sound of music so tender It brings back a night of tropical splendor It brings back a memory ever green Im with you once more under the stars And down by the shore an orchestras playing And even the palms seem to be swaying When they begin the beguine To live it again is past all endeavor Except when that tune clutches my heart And there we are, swearing to love forever And promising never, never to part What moments divine, what rapture serene Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted I know but too well what they mean So dont let them begin the beguine Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember When they begin the beguine Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play Till the stars that were there before return above you Till you whisper to me once more, Darling, I love you Then we suddenly know what heaven were in When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine When they begin the beguine"

She was an angel with snow white gown. So pure and innocent was she...Before the end wings torn off,and gown covered in blood. Someones eyes shining in the night Cold wind blows through the empty room. Light fades away, darkness has taken its form. Like a shadow, evil creeps in her heart. Darkness landing over the little one. Everytime shes thinking suicide. She sees the end and takes a razorblade cutting her wrists, the last thing is a message on the wallthank you F What have you done? Killed the little one What have you done? You raped your own little one."

"[Verse 1 Lecrae] I came home after a trip to Atlanta, a different planet Is where they thought I came from after my ship had landed Truth is I had this meeting with God and confessed my sin And he gave me this new beginning all I could do then was pen it All down in my notebook, just a lot of verses Me learning how not to curse was like learning to write in cursive She still flirting with me even though we up in church And Im fighting to memorize all these verses up in the word You would have never seen it coming A couple months ago Im getting high with my cousin And fast forward now around campus I am buzzing Not really but it felt like that, it felt like rap was just another passion Never thought Id be at the Grammys talking about my fashion You dont believe in God? Well how do you explain what happened? I promise we aint plan it, now Christians unashamed from Zambia to Manhattan Still looking for the pattern? Come On [Hook] What would it take to make you believe? More fire from the sky? Another part in the sea? The honest truth is, that you aint got the power to see And let me take you on this journey, it all started with me Wassup x2 [Verse 2 Lecrae] Most of the things I thought Id never do I did though And I aint nothing but a man standing up on his tiptoes Shoutout to Kirk Franklin, but I aint him Im what happens when hiphop lets all the Saints in I wouldnt call it gospel music, but Im Christian though And this what happen when a Christian flow Now its funny cause I dont really got a home And this industry saying leave him alone Unless he become a clone Have me singing the same old songs, no power in em But Im too hard to understand, Im an algorithm And evidently its evidence Im a resident Of somewhere that you know that you oughta be but you never been So try to get used to me, cause Imma settle in Reminding you to settle your heavenly settlement A sight for sore eyes, or an eyesore, it dont matter I own a label, and guess what, Imma sign more"

From the back of your heart To the palm of your hands Thats what you wanted A bloody kiss a second chance Dont cover your eyes Right before you die Embrace the night come to life Inside you know its right Say goodbye Josies in love tonight with the undead She sacrificed all she had Her heart wont beat again Josies in love with the undead From the look on your face To the fear in your eyes Thats what you wanted Eternal life screaming cries Dont cover your eyes As darkness bleeds the light Embrace the night come to life Inside you know its right Say goodbye Just say goodbye Just close your eyes

"Ten times a thousand years ago The gods from the stars came below Completed the creation of man The time of progress began Superior knowledge familiar to us Is regaining power from Sirius or Mars Once, when the 12th planet crashed with the earth A great flood drowned human wisdom and mirth Only few survived the tragedy All remains where dragged across the sea Encoded in all fairytales and myths The heritage of the ancient ones still lives Tomorrows dreams are memories from the past The cosmic principles will everlast But mystified fragments wont turn the page Distorted echoes from the age of Atlantis Ignorance is all I can see Dumbness our true entity Time is not ripe for enlightenment We cant use the key in our hand"

Upon strong and fast horses thousands have ridden beyond our borders. Our standards has been brought across the whole continent Hearts of stone and minds of steel. Defiel all foes and crushed their bones. Gathered under the respected flag with minds set on conquering. Hearts of stone and minds of steel. Defied all foes and crushed their bones. Bonded by their nation they pledged allegiance to the kings crown. Im pulled into the endless theories in the chronicles of crusades. Lost in a time of blood and steel as Im enchanted by the things they tell. Most of the soldiers who rode into war courageously fell for the enemys sword. The few who finally returned carried the light burden of gold.

"Another blackened night. I hope to walk in dreams. But aint scared. Be desperate. Blades are turning, In my tombs deep. Cant forget the torment, On my soul and my brain. Keep clashing till you die. Till your power is fall. Kick the chair and shut your eyes. See a dream for real time. Im still awake and, Want more and more. Poison spreading, In my tired vein. Cant see and feel. My death is near.I know He pounded the hook fastly, But never can get me. One day i will go to, Walls of heaven. Turn back and run when, Darkness still in my heart. I can hear the drums. The hellhounders of god. War is never stop, In my relentless soul."

I hear the streets calling for the feast Scorz is a beast I was asleep They was roaring showing all of their teeth Fighting for jungle scraps Surrounded by the hungriest cats My appetite like a herbivore Nothing I havent heard before Dictionary words galore Wolf skin berzerker call First verse merc em all If not Im the first to fall Coming back like dracula Pulling vampire teeth out with pliers Sleep a hundred years after ya Zombified microphone Al capone massacre Master of ceremonies Assassin ambassador I see the atmosphere Know youre there like mcloud Night vision Spot your cardio vascular Rap is like the hunger games Revolution hunger pains Probably end up on a island Surviving on monkeys brains But Im good with the goose feathered arrows Moving at the speed of a shadow In a gaps that narrow Nina Smith I have been sitting and waiting next to lions When they are roaring Ive been biding my time I have been sitting and waiting next to lions While theyve been sleeping Ive been watching the time How can I compete with the wolf of wall street? Snapping at my feet While weve got nothing to eat I see sharp suits Laptop criminals making smart loot Maybe I can write our way out of this dark loop Same cycle no doe Recycle the old flow Even with a 9 to 5 Stability is a no go So I hunt with the skills I acquired Everybody Alan sugar Til they get their mic fired Im up late and quite tired Gotta take the kids to school A caveman with a writing pad A different set of business tools Sending out warning shots Aiming just to miss the fools Feeling frustrated Living within the system rules Double agent Plan of attack lyrically Im I talking to myself Like a shakespearean soliloquy Split between characters Sense and sensibility 6th sense ability More advanced than the military I tap your mic like M.I.6 Am I sick? I sleep using one eyelid Feeling cornered like a wounded animal Surrounded by fake politicians In a zoo full of cannibals Learn to live with the pain without tramadol Its only a matter of time before the plan unfolds History is gone The presents never doubtful The future is a mystery The truth is in the outcome Chorus I have been sitting and waiting next to lions When they are roaring Ive been biding my time I have been sitting and waiting next to lions Its no secret I have been biding time Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder How I keep going from under
25 bucks and a bottle of wine The pressures on but I feel fine I crawl into a hole for a couple of days This God sure works in mysterious ways Heart has been racing Since I was a boy And I too bleed red Gonna crush kill destroy Paralyze me with a mind charade I took a wrong turn at the freak parade If less means more then more means less Im just a little white pawn in a game of chess Call me crazy I call it a ploy Still water runs deep Gonna crush kill destroy
"I wanna smile, in your arms you drive me wild Oh, please smile to me, be my baby I wanna smile, in your dreams I stay a while I wanna be your little guy, by my baby Come on and feel it, I mean it and everytime Ive seen it I never had the feeling, oh you hide it and I dream it I miss it, I kiss it and everytime you bliss it Baby I prove your love Come on and groove it and move it and everytime you do it Ive never seen you smiling, when you sad, oh I will blew it I mean it, Ive seen it and everytime I dream it Baby I prove my love Oh my baby, its my love you see Oh my baby, come on and smile to me Only with your love, Ill make it true love Only forever, well stay together Come on, dont hide it, beside it and everytime you light it I always have the motion, oh I love it and I guide it I take it, dont fake it and everytime you make it Baby, prove my love Come on and say it, I pray it, your smile will gonna make it I always have the feeling that your smile will gonna kick it I mean it, Ive seen it and everytime I dream it Baby, prove my love Oh my baby, its my love you see Oh my baby, come and on smile to me"
"[Verse 1 NDGO] They listen to this soliloquy as I christen their mind state As the molecules vibrate, we get hot and the skies stay Im gonna break down the estate now southern Of sly brothers and sisters repenting without druthers I focus while I can get it, misspoken into existence And tokin has let me visit no where close to astral missions So smoking I am not missing, dimensions is what Im spittin Dismissing all that was given as knowledge when we were children This time Im finally awake, my eyes are wide and theyre open More open than when Im baked, but hit it and heres to hoping That one day we flip the oceans and find a way to escape Until then we create as the bible did for faith Wait, stitches on my soul from this battle with Satan And losing laughter with foes just on account of impatience But if I wait for the glory how am I sure of the time So I just stay on the ride and keep the shore on my mind [Verse 2 Irahnik] Induced exuberance, my humerus is humorous Reinforcing numerous uteri, king of Budapest No studies found in bibliotecas, this a government setup Tryna get up, check up, shoot a new baretta Exude the crude chemicals, used to using medical Tentacles got me wrapped up, experiments were skeletal Elements got me skeptical substances, no oregano That night was unforgettable, as if I took injectables Juxtapose my old prose, screw the cons and love the pros Blow it over the cliffs of Dover, I know I decomposed And I suppose when I compose, you thought it was fake But an original acid addict blowing grass was once my place But now Im looking up, phoenix rising from the ashes Now imagine sacred dragons saying that my wish was granted If I wait for the glory how am I sure of the time So I just stay on the ride and keep the shore on my mind"
Walking on a still green seahave you got the faith to let It be? Without falling through like an anchor tied to your Weighted memories of guilty times Stepping on a bed of coals does little damage to the icy souls Cause theres just one bridge between pain and hope So keep mind sharp enough to stay afloat while Youre here......
"Lost dogs of God Wandering leashed To the light of lies To shadows of darkness Leashed blind slaves with suppurate cadavers With empty gazing eyes They wander towards destruction Vivere Non Est Necesse Sheeps dare not to think Tearing the odours of life Damned ojnes embracing death Quem Motuum Manu Miserat Feebleminded tremble with fear Before their liberating death Afraid to reach the other side They march like slaves without destiny Dominated, dethroned Life harnessed for fear Without warning Like wolves they pray damnation There was once light and God And the kingdom of Heaven Now theres only death and darkness Hell and no hope"
It must have been a dream That vanished from that day Perfectly serene How dare we lose that day Theres no way To save his face again How long can he stray Single out in space I wonder if shell stay Or burn his remains Theres no way To save his face again And since that day Its gone away Theres just no way To save his face again His wrists are blue and green And now we know to slap his face Theres bruises on my knees But I didnt know that I couldnt pray Theres no way To save his face again I guess Ill just say No Not again

"A carpenter at reschs brewery and veteran of the Boer War A regular at Randwick rifle range and yet he urged for more So when England declared war on Germany, Australia did as well Alfred John Shout swapped chisel for rifle for in war he did excel Captain Shout was soon known as a cheery, well liked and brave man And on landing at ANZAC cove into and at the enemy he did ran He led an advance and captured territory known as Baby 700 Captured Turks were stunned as their belongings were quickly plundered At Gaba Tepe although wounded, carried more than a dozen injured mates Out of the firing line, to safety and out of reach of a doomed fate Injured again his arm shattered but he refused to go to the rear Third time wounded amidst his protests, from the line he was dragged clear Then came the fateful day, he was thirty three and one day old Clearing Sasses Sap at Line Pine his VC medal citation is told He charged through trenches with Captain Sasse who stabbed and shot Whilst Shout used jam tin bombs to lob at all the Turks he spot He lit three at the one time in preparation for the next assault These crude homemade devices contained bullet shells and bolts He threw one down the way and was about to lob another When one of the remaining two was faulty and blew asunder The explosion took his right hand, his left eye and part of his chin Those near were shocked this red haired digger still managed to grin Though hideously maimed and bleeding freely he directed the attack In time stretcher bearers came and took his weakened body down the track He remained positive that he would heal and soon return to the front But those around him knew Lone Pine would be his final stunt On ship on route to hospital, his heart failed, his soul set free This brave VC winner died a hero and was solemnly buried at sea"

Womb of nature. Spoil and ruin. Death yawn seethes. Fire burns with no light. Hell through a locked gate. Spiritual judgement. Vast profundity obscured. Blasphemous union.

"Interlude Safety For The Soul [Jeffrey R. Holland] When Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum started for Carthage to face what they knew would be an imminent martyrdom, Hyrum read these words to comfort the heart of his brother Thou hast been faithful wherefore thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father A few short verses from the 12th chapter of Ether in the Book of Mormon. Before closing the book, Hyrum turned down the corner of the page from which he had read, marking it as part of the everlasting testimony for which these two brothers were about to die. I hold in my hand that book, the very copy from which Hyrum read, the same corner of the page turned down, still visible. Later, when actually incarcerated in the jail, Joseph the Prophet bore a powerful testimony of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Shortly thereafter pistol and ball would take the lives of these two testators In this their greatestand lasthour of need, I ask you would these men blaspheme before God by continuing to fix their lives, their honor, and their own search for eternal salvation on a book and by implication a church and a ministry they had fictitiously created out of whole cloth? Never mind that their wives are about to be widows and their children fatherless. Never mind that their little band of followers will yet be houseless, homeless and friendless and that their children will leave footprints of blood across frozen rivers and an untamed prairie floor. Never mind that legions will die and other legions live declaring in the four quarters of this earth that they know the Book of Mormon and the Church which espouses it to be true. Disregard all of that, and tell me whether in this hour of death these two men would enter the presence of their Eternal Judge quoting from and finding solace in a book which, if not the very word of God, would brand them as impostors and charlatans until the end of time? They would not do that! They were willing to die rather than deny the divine origin and the eternal truthfulness of the Book of Mormon The Book of Mormon is true, and was given to bring happiness and hope to the faithful in the travail of the latter days. Brothers and sisters, God always provides safety for the soul, and with the Book of Mormon, He has again done that in our time. Remember this declaration by Jesus Himself Whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived and in the last days neither your heart nor your faith will fail you. Of this I earnestly testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen [Paramore] Dont try to take this from me... Dont try to take this from me... Nowowowowowowowow Dont try to take this from me... Dont try to take this from me... Nowowowowowowowow Feels like Im waken from the dead and everyones been waiting on me... Least now Ill never have to wonder what its like to sleep a year away... But were we indestructible? I thought that we could brave it all... I never thought that what would take me out was hiding down below... Lost the battle, win the war... Im bringing my sinking ship back to the shore... Whoever you are... Were starting over, or head back in... Theres a time and a place to die but this aint it... You can be forgiven... If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow Dont try to take this from me... Dont try to take this from me... Nowowowowowowowow Dont try to take this from me... Dont try to take this from me... Nowowowowowowowow Wish I could find a crystal ball for the days I feel completely worthless... You know Id use it all for good, I would not take it for granted... Instead, Id have some memories for the days I dont feel anything... At the least they will remind me not to make the same mistakes again... Lost the battle, win the war... Im bringing my sinking ship back to the shore... Whoever you are... Were starting over, or head back in... Theres a time and a place to die but this aint it... You can be forgiven... If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it... [Jeffrey R. Holland] We are at war, and for these next few minutes I want to be a one man recruiting station... Of course the great thing about this call to arms is that we ask not for volunteers to fire a rifle or throw a hand grenade... No, we want battalions who will take as their weapons... Every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of god... [Angel] When what has to be has been, Ive learned to grin... When light is dim, life is grim, life in sin, I can look too Him just like the men of Helaman... Now is the time for this to end, a grand omen Were going in, this for him, for our friend, and all of our kin, amen for the final battle hymn... So let the flames begin again... Ignite the flame within ... Id rather never win, to last forever without sin... So sign me up now for the war... Our coup de main, we can come to fore... Our time is Now, atwo by two, 2 Timothy 2 3 and 4... If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it now.. Nowowowowowowowow If theres a future, we want it... Nowowowowowowowow Nowowowowowowowow Nowowowowowowowow"
"Sat in the corner of the garden grill With the plastic flowers on the windowsill No more miracles, loaves and fishes Been so busy with the washing of the dishes Reaction levels much too high, I can do without the stimuli Im living way beyond my ways and means Living in the zone of the inbetweens I can see the flashes on the frozen ocean Static charge of the cold emotion Watched on by the distant eyes Watched on by the silent, hidden spies But still the warmth flows through me And I sense you know me well No luck, no golden chances No mitigating circumstances now Its only common sense There are no accidents around here I am willing, lay your hands on me I am ready, lay your hands on me I believe, lay your hands on me, over me Working in gardens, thornless roses Fat men play with their garden hoses Poolside laughter has a cynical bite Sausage speared by the cocktail satellite I walk away from from light and sound Down stairways leading underground But still the warmth flows through me And I sense you know me well Its only common sense There are no accidents around here I am willing, lay your hands on me I am ready, lay your hands on me I believe, lay your hands on me, over me Over me"

"Paint it splendor gone stale. Big, bold, black and blue. Paint it however you can hide it. Still such an ugly view from here. Dont lose sight as we grow. Daylight deceives dim minds. Fabric grins. Judging eyes Tender toes. Friends like that dont mean a thing to me. Half empty bottles, broken, Thrusted deep through my disease. Anchored between concrete walls. Separate, separates, for the whole world to see. Sober son made it through. And I have so much to show for it too. And in the morning I know youll feel it too, Im still just as dead as you. As you...

When will the light take over these dark days And will she ever wake and know it is all a lie? Her eyes are closing slowly The pain increases everyday She wanted to fight but walked away and now theres nothing left to say She used to live, she used to give She always enjoyed life the way it was meant But clouds they came and played their game Casting a spell so shed fade away But will she stand up to fight and protect her life Be what she wanted to be... an Angel in the dark Her dreams are taking over The puzzle remains a mystery But she ought to know by now its just imaginary"

"Lonely thought about a void that feels so close A lonesome phantom shivers from the coldness around You are watching the chaos with broken wings of crystallized glass Blood is falling like branches that breed For every time your heart pound Weak and sad, All that occurs will blind you Like a lightning from the sky Weak and sad, The Death will come to us all Impressions burning like fire Beating rain that cuts through your skin like knives Only shivering shades of red and black You glance out on the scene that gives you a feeling of elation Everything is so silence and calm now til the second you hit the ground The clouds are slowly falling down towards the red edge of the horizon You are asking yourself over and over again where did everything go? Torned and injured but no one can hear your lamentation The mist appears from the field that you are standing on Mourning tones performed in agony Cold, you are trying to find warmth, in vain Loneliness spreads its wings around you Where you stand on your mound"

"The soldier in the grave is screaming for vengeance. What did I fight for, what did I die for? Hes looking for an answer, looking for a clue. But still he wonders I really dont know. Fight for the nation, fight for the peace. So shut up, get down on your knees. Fight for the nation, fight for the peace. Screaming for vengeance, screaming for blood. Still he wonders Is there a God? Give him the answer, give him the clue. Its a soul on the run and that soul could be you. So let him rest in peace. You got to do your best to hate your enemy. Kill for fun. Were never on the run. Fight for your life, you have to be brave. Fight to kill or you are nothing to save. You better live today, you may be dead tomorrow. Even if you ask youll never know the truth. You only live one time and time cant be borrowed. And no one will bring back your youth."

"Feed him fear, Feed him eternal hatred. The skies will burn as they pillage the earth of life. Tearing at the throat of existence. They bleed us dry. A million tusks and a million eyes emerge from the shadows. Their jaws unhinge as they froth at the mouth with hunger. Our hearts pounding with fear as the trumpets sound their ascension. Birthing a plague of devastation. A plan for bloodshed devised beneath our very soil. The serpents shed their rotting skin and swarm the cracks of the earth. In his presence they cower as he arises from his throne. His gruesome slaughter unleashed upon the world. Watch as the vultures circle. Watch as the maggots feast upon this human wasteland. The devour the flesh and blood of man with teeth of annihilation. The earth turns to ruin. Nothing is spared."

"Stone cold reality, clinging hard to my anxiety Sensors inside of me, trigging pain and instability. Denying the source, disconnected and sore The choice is there but my eyes are blind Now what can be done? I stand alone Something inside me tells me something is wrong Fighting alone, exhausted and torn This time its for real but my will is weak What if Ill fail, no one will stay Put out the light, wave of anxiety I ride... A stone cold heart Further into the shade... Torn and confused Wave of anxiety Torn by the rage and the fear... Choking my soul, reacting too slow The choice is there but my mind is weak Now what can be done? I stand alone Blindfolded, torn by the rage and the fear Madness awaits, watch me reload This time its for real and theres no turning back What if Ill die, no one will cry Blessed by the pain, let the madness begin...."

Wont you let me in, see where I have been I know what youre going through Why dont you come out, see what Im all about Its the least that you could do Turn down the bed, the only comforter you find Lying in the dark Try to fall asleep, you pray your soul to keep But you dont know what for Turning the pages in time only to find empty space When will you realize theres still time To write in its place Waking up from another lonely night, coffee for one And you look in the mirror think maybe its time Step out in the sun And still you see true friends are hard to find But now you see that Im not wasting my time"
"[Verse 1] I wonder if i die will my mother start to cry? I wonder if theres a heaven in the big blue sky? Theres so many questions on my mind but theres just no answers I think the government already found a cure to all cancers But their hiding it from the public Thesis new stars are the Muppet a puppet Are they in someones control? Did they really sell their souls? Is their really a Illuminati? Is their really a secret society? Is the government hiding something from us? If someone pulled out a gun are your friends the runners? Or are they he ones who ride with you, and die with you, and cry with you till the end Or are they the ones who wear a mask to pretend their your friends Or do they hate you? do they want you to die? Or do they want you alive to survive with good health Or do they want their greedy hands to touch your wealth I trust no one on this earth only my self [Verse 2] Was 911 planned? Theres so many thing on my mind that i just dont understand Are the prisoners from camp 14 free? Are they now living their dreams? Or are the kids dying before they turn 13? Would you do anything for the fortune? Are women in Korea still forced to get an abortion? What if that baby coulda been Jesus the return of our lord But you killed him with tools and a sword with a cord His blood hitting the floor Does the government not care about the poor? They spend millions and billions on the war Did the government planned to kill 2pac Shakur? And Michael Jackson? Or did it happen just to happen? Are people still dying from starvation? And is our nation doing something to help the population? What if we can breathe in space? But the government told us we cant just so we wont try to escape [Verse 3] Did Illuminati send SPM to jail? with no bail? When i die will i go to heaven or hell? SPM said him self that someone was coming for him But whose him or whose them? i dont know I guess they dont wanna see the Mexican rolling in doe Rocking the shows, getting nice clothes who knows Who knows if he was innocent? Now hes spending 45 years in the prison With no evidence, i guess they dont want to fuck with the Mexican Are people still getting high off medicine And was Adam high off needles when he killed all those people In sandy hook school, or was he just evil and cruel Did he commit suicide because he knew he was gonna die Or did he do it because he was tired of life? Is Obama gonna take away our rights to bear arms leaving us unarmed with no weapons"

Im under fire blood red sky Underneath the war machine Fight for whats right dont ask why Just make the sacrifice Desensitized but my eyes Still recognize the pain Truth stark and real fight or die Retreat has no place in this game In the dark and under fire Believing our cause was justified Caught in the crosshairs condition dire Trying a case of do or die In the blink of an eye I took someones life Its no wonder why Im hunted by it still Bright Flickering light snubbed by my numbing hands Dont understand One finger slip and its over for him Alls fair in war so they say But later as I try to sleep I just cant help but replay When I sat in as deity Was this man a loving father? Was this man a loving son? Though it was one of us or the other I dont feel like a lucky one In the blink of an eye I took someones life Its no wonder why Im hunted every night I still hear his cries And think about his wife and his kids And all that he could have been If only wed have been friends In a blink of an eye
"I descended from her witcherous womb From the stun she resided on that hallow moon She clawed the walls as they cut the chord To drown at first breath she was assured Her torturous acts from her gutless tomb Blind eyes they turned as they fled the room Submerged in guilt this wicked shrew As a thorn in her side, so the baby she threw Illness invades the vain of a lady so drenched in pain Cold is a shallow stare, with blood she draws without a care A passion to scald her young, her story remains unsung Its that loving hand upon your face that keeps you in your place. Vicious little bitch, shed have burnt as a witch, as predicted she inflicted with disastrous twist, with her malicious tale unsung, she provoked in many tongues, they called her lady tyranny Come, mother leave it be, let those demons sleep... Burn mother, let us be... for our loss you shall not reap... For what you cruelly sow... They called you lady tyranny. Relives her fears with a skin stained belt, its a feeling like youve never felt To watch her flesh and blood deflate, agony reflects glass eyes dilate Remorse an emotion that rarely shows but anger and hate in her cheeks they glow To drown me at birth, a task never done, pray not to wake to the nightmare she spun. Vicious little bitch, shed have burnt as a witch, as predicted she inflicted with disastrous twist, With revenge waiting at her door, beating on the child she bore, they called her lady tyranny Come, mother leave it be, let those demons sleep... Burn mother, let us be... for our loss you shall not reap... For what you cruelly sow... They call you lady tyranny. The anger biting back at you, Just a reflection of life once knew, It pains you to admit what you are, Parental wounds seep a hideous scar. Come, mother leave it be, let those demons sleep... Burn mother, let us be... for our loss you shall not reap... For what you cruelly sow... They blamed you lady tyranny."

"Gather round and listen close Ill now sing you a song Of blessed days gone by As sung once upon a time... Close your eyes and fly away To blessed days Ere the Elves fled this world, Ere dwarfs turned to stone... The world was fair, The mountains tall, the sky clear The rivers run crystalline Ere the dryads turned to willows... Close your eyes and fly away To blessed days Ere the Elves fled this world, Ere dwarfs turned to stone... Sing with me and dream Of the beauty that once was Of the deep woods wherein The Faery folk did dwell... Can you remember at all The blessed days When knights roamed the land And dragons slain lay in their caves? Can you recall The name of the one The hero that put the giants to the sword And was hailed by all in a continent afar? Close your eyes and fly away To blessed days Ere the Elves fled this world, Ere dwarfs turned to stone..."

"One more bender last night Can see it today through My blurred sight I feel the booze in me Diffusing its poison slowly Pathetic animal life Wrenched in duality Two egos, permanent strife Abandoning reality Paralyzed.. My body cries Hypnotized... But my soul denies Paralyzed.. My body dies Hypnotized... By my own lies True bitches live in the bottle Fooling me has become their Struggle Its always the same refrain I drink till the last drop East my brain I detest the one in the mirror Am I you, are you me? I dive back in the bottle Deeper Or maybe out of me? I hate to see those eyes And that wilted mouth That lies That ripped and dirty skin The man and the jinn within Regressing from dry to dry But keeping on boozing Meanwhile If you were to meet me Youd say Life left his body erstwhile A tree, without a mouth to Swallow, and without eyes to See this decay, has got a Better chance to welcome The morrow cause his roots Will never betray Never sober over the Past years Never sober is better No more hangovers Theres no future No past life to tell And in the nights to come Ill booze as well"

"Midnight looms, my eyes open The graveyard calls to me. An abscessed Eden of putrid bodies. Masturbating as they rot with the creatures below. I intend to victimize the entombed. I wont stop till each bodys been exhumed. Searching for newly dead to excavate. Ill display her rotting corpse in erotic state. Open the coffin, VOMIT! Spewing with excitement! I undress the bodies. Erotica unearthed. Morning dawns, relatives come to visit the deceased. Traumatized, their loved ones posed on their graves with their genitalia exposed. Memory of death instead of life forever remains."

With every step I take Im closer to the flame In hopes to cleanse my flesh from all the human stains Sick from every plague That tore open my veins From all the loss of faith My heart is gone today Drink away my hope I laugh while on the floor And all the things we do Is hurt each other for you Living in the moment Burning within the ashes Of everything thats gone Nothing can be done Each day I live through this And hope that things are bliss But everythings the same Why do I exist? Defeated by the times From every breath I take If this was meant to be How can we survive? Sleeping in the streets The future looks so bleak Soon well all be here This is what I fear... Sleeping in the streets The future looks so bleak Soon well all be here This is what I fear... Children left for dead Money owns the rest Death will end our fate Unable to escape Sleeping in the streets The future looks so bleak Soon well all be here This is what I fear And the same question always appears Will we make it?

"She was like fire Burning through anything crossing her path Drowning in tidal waves he was like water Devouring the blaze The kiss of sorrow A brick fortress built around her heart Woe cloaks her vision The perfection of his innocence Left her in suspense Of unnerving terror Scatter thee, on welkin soil The brightest fall hardest For they fly so high Dragging through the mud Their children siphon her spirit Her light was dimmed by those who ravage her flesh, the earth Like a hunter, Strikes at night The spear had been broken, Yet protruding from his heart The earth groans and trembles All creation, bowed to the dead A sombre hymn of severance All under the moon shifted A tomb of discord eternally dim, aglow is he The great divide, Mother Earth father Sky."

"Lies! Are the words they use To control your behaviour, To control your soul. Fear! Is the instrument To corrupt your essence, To corrupt your life. Lies they use against your will, Deceive is the key to access to you, Hatred is what they install inside your life. Lies they use to hide their nature, A nature full of nothingness. A blackened life of impure emotions, A blackened life of fantasies. Hatred! Is what they spread, A manifestation Of a lower creation. Envy! On your achieves, Is a justification For their less dedication. They suffocate your being To a state of a mental annihilation. They try to tear your inside, They try to make you feel you are numb. Hatred! Is what they spread, A manifestation Of a lower creation. Lies! They predicate To protect a world Of impure transformation. They search inside your fears, They search inside your deepest frights, To make you feel the way they are, To make you feel so empty inside."
"Live from the funeral of God, this is the day youve awaited, sponsored and celebrated, he has answered your prayers, corpses have piled up with your riches, they have spilled over onto the earth, we spit and wear our fear like masks, everything is locked into a form, interrupt the feed, its closing in... the sky is so dark, are men no worse than demons? Are armies not thirsty for blood? The desire of their hearts has been met, eons and eons, decades of liars, drunk with power atop a mountain of corpses, their arms and legs fail and they crawl like serpants, to address those who are mourning, live from the funeral of God, there is no reason to be afraid, everything is under control, we shall miss him"
"All histories resumed in a verse Are prayers that were not heard By the insane past That saw us fall Decaying before an awful sight The sun cries for us all As death will at last Rule in our hearts Winds Turn into mourning storms They carry me like dry leaves to dispel the autumn Conspiracy based on silence Destroys softly our hopes Devours our roots I close my eyes, where brimstone tainted tears are born They Recall the beginning Back to the very doorway of Asterions labyrinth Remember once more your astral insanity And spawn your doom Remember your origin Youve played with the dagger of sin As you heard the Declaiming of Luciferian verses that your tongue has never met Because youre afraid"

"Years ago we were born in the valley of our fathers We grew up with the trees Where strong winds used to blow oh, sing this song with us children of this valley o We went to school to learn this life And what we need to survive That Lenin, Marx and Co. is our biggest foe sing this song with us children of this valley o We all had dreams for our way, we tried to reach for the stars Big train driver, deep sea diver, pretty girls, expensive cars At fifteen we must decide what to do our whole life long I was too small for the police what a shame, dont get me wrong So I sold clothes in a suit to rich people, those were the days But three years later I said goodbye, I was looking for new ways ...for new ways One friend of mine went to Berlin to change the world and paint the wall Maybe this was the cause, maybe more, for the wall to fall With this money gone, had too much fun, he sold his body to the industry They gave him money, gave him drugs, they took his dream to be free That was the last Ive ever heard of him, maybe all were just lies But when Im served in his parents shop, I just see sadness in their eyes ...in their eyes"
"Demonic forces gather in the darkside Im swallowed in the realm of treachery... In a vast nocturnal silence A glow of new light is born out into the night... Dark obsessions breed my dementia As I enter the gates of mysteries A cursed world of madness and dismay! Ive seen an angel fallen from the sky... Master LUCIFER is risen once again! Summoned here in the black fire of his throne In the temple where the hordes now feast his power... They play and sing with all their agony Obscura Symphonia agonized screams of fear! Obscura Symphonia here the lament of the demon souls! Frozen winds of ancient blasphemy Bring forth damnation to spread the symphony! Awakened dead they rise up from their graves, Hypnotized by the evil sound of death..."
in feet of the father children crying for mercy taking last breath before the eucharist eat it the blessed flesh drink it divine fluids from father children of god cry for mercy children of god pray for salvation road to heaven is hard father tests your faith are you property of father? are you one of the children of god?
"naked and pale are your words of salvation drowned in fake presence , forever a feeble atempt to evoke a reality blindfolded from life , death haunts you down injected by fear and created words the hands of God strangles you inhale his guidance , bow before him obey , serve , adapt and die mirror images of God preaching deformed imaginations accepted gathered throats , religiously cut marionettes kneel , question not stillborn sons , baptized with empty eyes staring towards heaven alike his words you?ll never be stigmata wounds you?ll never see thy precious horde will die with thee everlasting flames , purgatory , burn with me ....."
"Our pleasures be joyless doleful experiences. We seek not lifes beauty but cherish its funeral aspects. We crave the misfortunes rich in their non entity rejoice in celebrating less severe tragedies. In the toil to exist we excrete individuality whilst captivating internment in cloned identity. Real is The oration of stone possessed emotion. I yearn isolation from this realisation. Reject the elation of blissful tranquility, obsessions they lay with the bleak and sinister. A wealth of treasures be ours to take possession yet we break bones and gruel to savour simulations. Disciples of the drabness devotees of worthlessness consent to endure the anguish and form only ashes. Real is the oration . Oh yeagh let me go. Let me wander through buildings immense in their desolation. At peace from your catastrophe here with gargoyles as my friends."
"The condition of the people and our national priorities Get broadcast across the country like a speech from royalty Speech, want and fear are the freedoms that were fighting for The pursuit of happiness of course and who could want for anymore? Yes, the nations in a state and so step up and take a bow Thats the state of the union, state of the union now Well just across the water, well theyre thinking that theyve got it made Cause they had a vote and everything and everything was all explained Regulation, immigration is what caused them to complain But theyre looking to the government to make it all great again Well you need to know just who it is, thats in control and how Thats the state of the union, state of the union now Do we ask you to serve? Do we get what we deserve? Do we ask you to die? Do we ask you to lie, over and over again? Sell it to me, sell it to me, sell it to me now Sell it to me, sell it to me, sell it to me now Tell it to me, tell it to me, tell it to me now Tell it to me, tell it to me, tell it So what could be worse than a xenophobic, sociopath? Well the answers one with power and the willingness to attack Well theyre looking to the hard man to update them with the facts And theyre looking to their glorious and patriotic past Its just the case of us and them and were not going to back down Thats the state of the union, the state of the union now."
"Time to escape, time to breathe, but to cast a shadow here, you have come to devour every part of me. Isolated, oscillating in a universal, constant stream. You are the voice inside my mind and behind a hundred violent tendencies. Come to me. Dont deny I am your new devil merge with me. Be as one. I am your new devil. You pull me eight feet under. The smell of sulfur is getting stronger. I can feel it in my eyes as the parody subsides. The air turned to ash, ash turned to stone, stone eroded. Lovingly, every eye on me was gone. Shells made of glass, tokens of love. Memories worth caring for in the end they matter not. I bend time, always behind. Forever there in the dark, you hide. Give in to me, die within us. The world will never be a better place."

When my heart stops Will my wings unfold Did you know that I had no one but you When my eyes close Will your blood turn older Did you know that I had no one but you In the snow veil Where the ring of promise fell In the cool white air One stood abiding When the road turns Will my ghost find freedom Did you know that I have nothing So I Sold my love Forgot the vow It feels like nothing comes to mind I pull the weight And sing That theres a new cloud over my grave Now I know That it did kill me when I could not have you Sold my heart

Why are you living there now? Stolen away Baby, taken away Why are you living in Heaven today? Why are you living there now? He will break your kingdom down He will tear your kingdom down"

"To some people rap is just a lot of manure Others say the planets sick and hiphop is the cure Some people say commercial rap isnt pure But to me every rapper is an entrepreneur You wanna make a difference? You wanna to make a living? You wanna teach the children? You wanna make a million? Either way, you gotta find a way to get their attention And if you dont then no ones gonna listen I know a few anticapitalist rappers Whose activism consists of selling anticapitalist Raps to their fans in fancy little packages While ranting about how rap is cashobsessed Try to not give yourself an aneurism Or get your panties twisted, just cause your angstridden Antibusiness existentialism Is just a strategy to get more fans to listen Its like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder How I keep from goin under Its like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder How I feed my growin hunger Youre gonna make a lotta mistakes Its okay, you take a hit, you switch lanes Competition is extreme To get ahead you gotta switch Every record gets the fans it deserves Hiphop is a business first You wanna make a difference? Word Then go find yourself some customers A couple artists will hate this for sure And say success is just a curse Sour grapes get squished to syrup Cmon, dont shoot the messenger Hiphop started in the streets And then it spawned a whole industry Sorry if Im bein indiscrete But Im in it for the spinach and it isnt just me So if your songs are interestfree Then I doubt theyre gonna interest me Integrity makes you poor? Interesting I pay for things that impress me Its like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder How I keep from goin under Its like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder How I feed my growin hunger Youre gonna make a lotta mistakes Its okay, you take a hit, you switch lanes Competition is extreme To get ahead you gotta switch Rappers are crabs in a bucket, just ask em Theyre stuck with a tiny fanbase that happens to love it But they cant expand it without angering someone I couldnt handle that, man, I had to do somethin Heres a business plan for you selfpromote And grab onto some driftwood to help you float And when you got enough, built yourself a boat And fill it with likeminded folks to help you row You got two choices, you do it yourself Or you find somebody else with a use for your skills You take the red pill or blue pill Most businesses do fail, but you dont think you will? Im not tryin to say you aint different But it takes creativity to change directions real quick And go where the competition aint headed So if you get stuck in a single lane, switch it Its like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder How I keep from goin under Its like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder How I feed my growin hunger Youre gonna make a lotta mistakes Its okay, you take a hit, you switch lanes Competition is extreme To get ahead you gotta switch"

"My hands are shaking holding the gun Why god sent me here to the front line Politicians war Im not a part of this I bet that they wont take a bullet for me All those nights Ive cried in my bed The fear of dying doesnt make any sense The rain baptizes me in this bloody hell When will they appear? I cant tell Lightning, thunder and rain Our lives are wasted in vain Rising sun It will come to enlighten me The war has begun Will I kill to survive in this? Game of death We are pieces played by someone else Now my life passes before my eyes In my childhood I used to play dead With a wooden gun in my hand Learning this horror innocently Bullets, bombs and a flare Soldiers shooting everywhere My hands are tired of holding this gun I let it fall down, hitting the ground My eyes are blinded by the rising sun I cry the death of all those around"

"[Verse 1 Bliss] A wise man once said we exist in a bizzare combination of Stone age emotions medieval beliefs Godlike technology many people can reach I can sit on the beach see the sky turn violet red While moving through a planetary spiderweb See the jungle through the eye of the tigers head Black hat hackers fight from their lions den While truth lives and dreams that go free We got rickety boats bursting at the seams with refugees Check it While some kids fight just to make the honor roll Other kids fight just to claim the waterhole And you know it, the moment the air is motionless Compassionate emotions stick when your ocean shifts And I dont trust my TV news caster My world flips likes a 3D view master Look out the window and put it in a paragraph Watching life travel past back in cattleclass Harness the beat and the passion that your heart gives The Noah Ark kid, captain of his starship Dont let him tell you different to all you school kids Being smart is cool, prepare your mental toolkits And with this knowledge start to gauge your bandwidth The architecture of science and art can change the planet I got the fresh force I hopped and leapt forth So check it mate, Im the pawn to cross the chessboard [Hook Eso] Sometimes they try to break me down heyooh Other times I feel safe and sound heyooh And I dont know why Im weightless now But Im guessing its because were running on air Sometimes they try to break me down heyooh Other times I feel safe and sound heyooh And I dont know why Im weightless now But Im guessing its because were running on air [Verse 2 Eso] I was told that life is as easy as can be But apparently the tragedy is freedom isnt free Ive been bleeding on this beat and spilling my guts At the last supper where the gods fill up my cup See the truth is, its all in your head And time will only stop still when your wings are spread Theres no map to buy for the trail to my heart So Ill be coming home after I sail to the stars And that kid hovers high yelling live, love or die While he swallows caterpillas and spits butterflies With a mic and a molotov missiles on a message Its a lunar eclipse when Im listening to records I brainstorm to rid the taxes and change laws The worlds on course to clash with the claymore The captain that came forth packing a chainsaw I never knocked, I took an axe to the stage door Im like the everlit match when the rain pours A legend to my friends coming back from a great tour The true cruisader stands up to the man Mind Over Matter turns handcuffs into sand Its contained in a flame and it lives in a heart beat So fuck this party man, give me the car keys I wanna give like Mr. Smith in Seven Pounds To change my brain to a plane that never grounds [Hook] Sometimes they try to break me down heyooh Other times I feel safe and sound heyooh And I dont know why Im weightless now But Im guessing its because were running on air Sometimes they try to break me down heyooh Other times I feel safe and sound heyooh And I dont know why Im weightless now But Im guessing its because were running on air Sometimes they try to break me down heyooh Other times I feel safe and sound heyooh And I dont know why Im weightless now But Im guessing its because were running on air Sometimes they try to break me down heyooh Other times I feel safe and sound heyooh And I dont know why Im weightless now But Im guessing its because were running on air"
"Vanities get shut, hear the starting shot These nights are our nights that we play We all came together, adrenalized blood Lets bring on what was taken away Cut down the fences, break every wall High is the night that we face This is our game and we are meant to destroy No one will change our, change our way The lights get smashed this spotll be splashed Youve lost your say Our force wont go away Its the end for us to blame The ones that do create more than just fake But today the dye got washed away And theres nothing left to say No single thing will be OK When everything has turned to grey Everything has turned to grey We came to bring the barrier down Nothing justifies to separate Lets tear down the borders and come together as one No longer well accept the doctrine A riot on fire, with burning desire A message for all out to see Cut down the fences and break every wall Lets paint this place as it should be The lights get thrashed This spotll be splashed Youve lost your say Elitism gets smashed Our blood we all share red Collective strength to spread something meant to last But today the dye got washed away And theres nothing left to say Its the start of our decay When everything has turned to grey Units are coming to tear away My last place of dreams and faith Soon everything is forced to fade As they tramp on our beliefs Like lifeless cold machines They kill until the last piece bleeds When the dirt gets washed away And theres nothing left to say The beginning of our decay When everything has turned to grey When our thoughts get locked away Youll be forced to meet your fate Nothing ever lasts in world so pale When everything When our dreams get thrown away Its the beginning of our decay When all colours begin to fade And everything has turned to grey"

"Your break is now over, return to your seats Look at the crack in the wall, breath the air in Its filled with disease Just like all of us soldiers, we arise, we despise the men that have brought us into this world. Shivering and cold Broken code. Overload The end is near I see it clear as day Its all that Ive ever wanted Withholding suffocating truth Vultures circle above me The storm clouds have fallen To create fire that walks on this earth And it burns all the good of this world So all that would be left is you Theyre your mother, your father Theyre your judge, your jury, your kings Theyre your gods Pulling the strings of your will and command You mindlessly walk through the sand Broken code. Overload The end is near I see it clear as day Its all that Ive ever wanted Withholding suffocating truth Vultures circle above me The waves crash against the walls of time The pillars are wasting away The oceans have crossed into the sky And swallowed my pride Please drown me The words that Ive spoken Are now but nothing is broken The walls an illusion A truth not found The end is near, I got to see the day I turned the world, I didnt feel I am feeling forgotten in sleep And I know its true, And I dont give a fuck about all that you do I say all this to you, so you can too feel Sucked out every light Ive ever known Only nine years to skin the wolf"

"I cannot see a way to escape My bleak destiny awaits The path Ive chosen, a mistake The chains that bind me will never break Long time ago I sacrificed My heart and soul for you I cannot find my peace of mind Look at the pain Im going through All this agony that I took away from you was just The sacrifice I had to give It was your final chance to live But you just kept going on and on like you did before You did not learn anything from this Why wont you offer me a helping hand to pull me out of the shadows that tie my soul to the depths of suffering My sacrifice was all in vain The gratitude youve shown was fake Please release me from this pain Theres nothing more that I can take Do you see me in the dark? My soul is burning in eternal flames for you to realize That you need to redeem yourself But youve abandoned me although I did this all for you My sacrifice was all in vain The gratitude youve shown was fake Please release me from this pain Theres nothing more that I can take"
"Rusty Ryan, back at it again One more time You want me to take you home? [Verse] With her, Im on another plateau I feel different so I made this rap slow In my zone, rhyming all alone So please let me rest, Ill be chilling in my chateau With lyricism, I fend off constant criticism For riddance, I hit em with the rudeboy rhythm But back to her, she sends me to outer space Away from this place that is filled with human disgrace She sends me away She leaves some speechless with nothing left to say I feel free, freer than before Back then my mind and soul were in a constant war Now Im in control, Ryan is the mentor This is what I was sent for to replenish, restore Your style, your smile, your ways Ive been regularly thinking about you, for days When Ryan reflects on you, he goes into a daze Maybe its just temporary, maybe just a phase You give me positive vibes, intriguing waves You turns my lows to highs, my crush to a craze To the person this concerns whoever you may be Please dont take these rhymes too seriously But heres a little tune for you my Mrs I wont be too sobby, not too many kisses I cant put into words what I feel only lyrics In three minutes, I make a soulless room feel like it has spirit You make me happy not glad The reverse of what Gorillaz said on that Clint Eastwood track Im a wizard, my rhymes are my magic My love lifes a curse, each relationship is tragic Whether Im the best dont need to be debated I live in the future, everyone is outdated Dont care if Im liked or if Im hated One things for sure I am underestimated And Im sacred, and Im the motherfucking shit you awaited Im still Ryan but now Im upgraded How come I see more clear when Im faded?

"Youre broken. Broken like a promise... Can you remember sunny days and the smiling face of love? My love, do you remember me? Hush now, hush now, silly girl dont cry, just put your hand in mine. I remember, the way you laughed and how we danced... all night. Wish I could have died in your arms. Hush now, hush now its almost time. Theres no more pain, no fear, put your hand in mine. All your wishes, all those kisses are here waiting for you. Come to me."
A whisper along the edge of dawn. The darkness of night holding its breath. Suffering a cosmic loneliness. My constant shadow touched me. Blessing the whispers of the night. The voice of the underworld. Suffering in a lonesome wilderness. Night took on a deathly look. Dancing into the unknown. Now I see... I see their faces. Their eyes glowing in the night. Becoming one... Becoming Eternity. I listened to the voice of silence. Voices in the night... Sing your songs of despair. Mournful... Yet filled with joy.
Electricity snapped from the sky And the trees stood still And in that nervous moment I was alone I was wanting you again The ceiling fan tries to keep up with the heat The chains clang in the third speed The bed and the bath tub and the yard and the kitchen Were all waiting Would you just come over over come over And shake the walls of this place Its quiet as a candle Im lonely Come over shake the walls of this place Times just a clock a shade down the hall And sometimes I just hate the day Id like to get a gun that can shoot down the sun Lets have a night that wont go away We dont need a name a word or a code For whatever were gonna call this Just keep the shirts and the hands and the jeans moving In a downward trend Would you just come over over come over And shake the walls of this place Its quiet as a candle Im lonely Come over shake the walls of this place Would you just come over over come over And shake the walls of this place Its quiet as a candle Im lonely Come over shake the walls of this place

"11.11 On a trip to Munnar, Pi notices a trio of hills, each with a temple, church, or mosque on it. Seeing the three equally spaced and realizing his foundation in the Hindu faith, he goes to meet Jesus Christ. He sees a priest from a distance and is astounded by his acts of love. He is confused, but enters the church anyways, wondering which statue is mean to represent the Catholic god 11.12 The following day he meets Father Martin on a return trip and learns more of Christianity and the nature of Jesus and his sacrifice. Pi tries to understand by comparing Hindu deities to the Christian faith but fails in doing so. Over the course of days, the two meet often and Pi answers numerous questions, attempting to learn more. Many of the answers end with love as the simple answer and Pi begins to relate Christianity with the concept of love. He decides he will become a Christian, praying at the church, then going back to the Hindu temple and praying thanks for helping him find the Catholic faith 11.13 A year passes and Pi experiences the same curiosity when he witnesses the Great Mosque. He sees it but is afraid to enter, so enters a local bakery instead. While talking to the bakerys owner, the owner is called to prayer by the muezzin the man at the mosque who calls the time for prayer. He witnesses the bakery owners relaxed, repetitive prayer motions and later thinks on it while praying at the Catholic Church 11.14 He goes back to the bakery to ask the baker questions on the religion and is led to the mosque where he participates in the bowing and prayers with the other Muslims"

I find refuge back in my breathing Results bare more repeating Halt an onslaught, carry their karma Salt of the earth, all these seeds, I feel like a farmer Oh how I love to garden Guard the sacred from the profaneness Still both are related I got a mind like a monkey Im just trying to tame it Even the bear climbs the tree To get a piece of the honey He doesnt care about them bee stings Hes just trying to eat things Not all of them are cuddly You are what you eat And who you keep in your company Everyone wants the money But they dont want to work daily I just want to feed my family Suffering deserves much respect Still both pain and pleasure are temporary Nothing lasts its like a fleeting memory Everything runs on energy Whats a friend without some enemies? My best opponent helped me more than any one of my homies He taught me whats really important, whats intrinsic And doesnt rely on something to begin with Whats melanin without the lack of pigment?

All we lost on our ways We will reconquer We will prevail Who will win this fight Insignificance or the I? How can I free myself From these faithful chains? A sleeping demon is not dead A demon laid in chains Remains untamed The day I stop to wonder Is the day I die From this grief and hunger A new spirit shines All we lost on our ways Our souls and dignity We will storm back All we lost on our ways We will reconquer We will prevail I bury something deep inside Belonging in the open wide I harbour a pain to grow Breed a cancer within my soul The day I stop to wonder Is the day I die All we lost on our ways Our souls and dignity We will storm back All we lost on our ways We will reconquer We will prevail

"The belly or the bully will pull the boy to me, were swelling in the sea. Teeth and fingernails strip the shell clean, thread my buttons and beads. And if the house is sadder when I leave you on your own just build another home stubborn Billygoat! Bitter to the bone, chopping timber and stone Forgive this request, see Im bleeding half to death. For days I drift and land in your hands, where all that I know is all I need to know. I take the pen and I write You are anything other than kind. The son will gift the colour when the ashes are grey on our mothers face. Giving counsel and giving us a name, such a tender exchange. But if youre growing bitter as I lead you through the breeze just lead me to the field. Scatter petals and bury me in weeds. Chop a cross from a tree Forgive this request, see Im bleeding half to death. For days I drift and land in your hands, where all that I know is all I need to know. But when the morning looks down on some river too shallow to hold or fire the ammo, hide between the digger and the plough"

"Another shooting on the southeast side. This a driveby, midday, Outside of the bus stop, by Fuller and Franklin. Or near there. Not far from the park. About a block from where the other shooting was last month. Or was it last week? Shots were fired from an SUV heading northbound, Eastown, The target a rival but they didnt hit the target this time. They hit a kid we think had nothing to do with it. And I travel backwards through time and space and I disintegrate, become invisible. I want to see it where I couldnt when it happened. I want to see it all first hand this time. I want to know what it felt like. So I float behind police lines, reconstruct the scene in fragments of memories. I want to know what his mother looked like up close, I want to see her leaning over his body. So I float there, transcend time. I want to capture it accurately. I want to know what the color of the blood was spilling out from the tarp onto the concrete. I want to write it all down so I can always remember. If you could see it up close how could you ever forget how senseless death, how precious life. I want to be there when the bullet hit. And the crowd poured out as the shots drowned into siren sounds, out of there houses now And over front yards, all the way up to the place where the police tape ran to mark the crime Scene. Everybody trying to catch a glimpse of what was happening, Of what was going on between the ambulance and all the cop cars. Everybody gossiping, Whose kid got hit? Whered it hit him? And who couldve fired it? Everybody wondering, How did it happen again? And is he dead? These children. Our kids. Everybody wondering how far they were from where the victims lived. And I visit them, their houses. Inside my dream I visit them. My spirit, soaring high and high up over King Park, leaves the crime scene, travels further back Till far before the shooting, through their windows, to their living rooms. I see them younger this time, playing games and doing homework. All these marks of youth soon transformed coldly into stone for fights and stupid feuds. For ruins wrapped in gold. And cruelly I recall why I have come To find a reason. But There cannot be a reason, not for death, not like this. Not like this. Three days later they made funeral plans. The family. Three days later a mother had to bury her son. Not far away the shooter holed up in a hotel near to the highway with a friend and the gun. That same gun. Hed fled immediately but was identified by witnesses, his picture on TV. Only 20 years old, they called him Grandpa. He was older than the others by a year, Maybe two. And he was safe for awhile until somebody saw him there and notified the authorities Who surrounded the hotel, first arresting an accomplice while attempting to flee, Then chasing him up the staircase to the floor where hed stayed. He closed the door hard Behind him, locked himself in the room. They couldve kicked in the door but knew the gun was still with him, One hed already used and so they feared what hed do. I floated up through the window of a room to the West. I hovered out to the hallway, tried to listen in. I heard them trying to reason, get him to open the door. His uncle begging and pleading, halfcollapsed to the floor. He preached of hope and forgiveness, said, There is always a chance to rectify what youve taken, make your peace in the world. I thought to slip through the door, I couldve entered the room, I felt the burden of murder, it shook the earth to the core. Felt like the world was collapsing. Then we heard him speak, Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself? Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself? Can I ever be forgiven cuz I killed that kid? It was an accident I swear it wasnt meant for him! And if I turn it on me, if I even it out, can I still get in or will they send me to hell? Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself? I left the hotel behind, dont want to know how it ends."

"The year is 2013 War and poverty plauge the globe. The common man is suffocated by overconsumption, religious extremists, and corrupt governments Citizens rebel, only to find that the regime they overthrew is better than the one they created. The global prescence of capitalist ideas drowns out the cries of the suffering then puts them to work in desolate factories and outsources their rights.

"A great lord came walking through the forest One morning with a weapon in his hand Rich was his castle, he lacked for nothing But killing was his plan When a white bird flew by she fell from the sky Nothing was found, only blood on the ground, she was gone Cursing his fortune He turned to the forest to kill once again And standing before him was a lovely young woman With her hand hung in pain When he saw her his eyes were filled with desire He said I must have her, she must be mine She will be mine... He offered her silver, he offered her gold But she threw it on the ground He fell to his knees and he begged her Oh please come with me What you wish will be found She said, Sir, Ill go if youll put up your bow And spare these creatures, leave them in peace You have no need... But her words were lost in the wind His eyes were fixed on a queen And all he saw was a woman And all she was, was a dream... Oh oh...And all he saw was a woman, and all she was Was a dream... He took her and bound her with ropes tied around her To his castle he did ride In the wood was a bower where stood an old tower And he threw her deep inside Then the birds left the sky and a terrible cry Brought thunder and lightning, rain falling down Tears on the ground... All through the days on her face he would gaze For she was lovely as the spring No words would she speak but Leave them in peace And some sad ballad she would sing Oh one day by the door, through the window he saw A single white feather lying on the floor She was there no more... Now that great lord is dying His cold heart is crying for the love of the girl For many an hour he has wept on the Tower For she meant more than the world And once in the sky, a white bird flew by He lifted his hands, and he cried out in pain Come back again... But his words were lost in the wind His castle was built upon sand All he has is the memory And all he yearns is her hand... Ah ah..All he has is this memory And all he yearns is her hand"

"The luminosity of your existence shall not succumb to the hands of negation. The contrary has taught me that with golden feathered wings you will ascend. The tragedy of such a day as this has burned its place in my peaceful mind forever. And I beheld your star, burning brighter than the rest. But as we who remember mourn, the stars do not, for your flare shall light the way for all those lost who wander. This tragedy has burned its mark in every corner of my heart, but it is to you that I look when I fall upon my knees my eyes forever towards the sky. It is with this sorrow in my mind that my eyes shall forever gaze upon the sky, knowing this truth more than myself, that this regret shall not prevail. But your memory still gives me strength. Dont be disheartened. Your journey does not end here. My eyes forever towards the sky, your journey does not end here."

"Is it so strange, its trouble when the leaves change It makes her cold It makes her want to interact with strangers Her fingers on the thermostat, taking off their coats and hats, How are you? I have no skills to bring this to a stop Huggings not a dance move Punchings not allowed I lost my night vision in a brawl But in the morning the loss seemed very small Huddle up with your boyfriend Huddle up with your good friends who have sealed the windows Removed the baby birds And with one idea, took the static from your hair and the exit plan from out between your bed and box springs Is it so strange? Am I so strange? Will it make her want to interact with strangers?"
"Prietene, nu te du acolo este slaul psrii morii... Eastern bound to far Carpathia, how the rain it stings my skin Brandys fire and thoughts of hometown fail to quell unrest within Mile on mile the coach wheels clatter, destination looms in sight Orloks castle ramparts tower through the blackened veil of night Soft, in the stark lit dreaming dark, the nightmare comes to me The curse to begin, blood anointing the skin, with the kiss of infinity Hearts race, pulse chase the price of greed is my humanity My lost mortality From the vein, lifes source behold Welcome, death let life unfold Mortified, have I become a victim of this barren place? Rank and stale, my heart hangs heavy, severed from loves embrace Ironbound caskets fall around me, kill what hope that I have left Thus revealed before me lies The Bird of Death... I stand alone in the gloom of the undeads tomb, my dread is quickening Here as I seek where the sleepless creep, in the silence sickening If I wait too late! I must return fate is calling me My fear is stalling me From the vein, let blood be drawn Welcome child of bloodless spawn What is this God forsaken thing which walks among us? And in silence of her room, a silent stranger stands in thrall Fatal the dart of the pure in heart the face of destiny By fickle fate beguiled, as thrice on thrice unheeded cockerel calls The kiss to begin, blood anointing the skin with the curse of infinity The light consumes his flesh, binding life and death as one...

"The old appeals to racial, sexual, and religious chauvinism, and to rabid nationalist fervor are beginning not to work. A new consciousness is developing which sees the Earth as a single organism, and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed. We are one planet."
"Hey you listen to me, I have to tell you that life will change, if you really want it. The world will not survive if you wait for a Messiah. You have to show a spirit and have to believe it. You will die if you dont change, Come on and show your will. Peace will come soom if we love our children Much harder than a flag or a nation. Iron curtain has to break, Berlin wall has to fall. The world was made as one creation. If we dont act, forget the future"

Remember When we met You said lets Walk together You said Will you Help me Proud marble arcs Streets of white stone Now theyre just a memory Monuments of our hollow vanity When the winds weep For a fallen land I think of you What was it that separated us? Does it really matter in the end? To dust well return But we created beautiful Eternal things Day and night Our hearts entwined What we built Surpassed our existence Remember When we lost ourselves In a storm of greed What looked wise In our eyes Was meant to become our demise When I bleed in your hands And the earth sighs under your step I remember why we lost Acid rain melts my hair Is there any meaning at all? Yet I still believe That we can save our soul When the winds weep For a fallen land I think of you What was it that separated us? Does it really matter in the end? To dust well return We and our beautiful Eternal things
Seems to me we could Make it all work out Seems to me by now You wont consider lies I really hope That youve found it all a thrill You have really shown Desire for the kill Were never giving up Theyll never bring us down No matter what they say about us Well be back around Sometimes in our lives We all have to bleed Sometimes giving up Things we thought wed need Internalize your anger Intensify the pain Get back all you lost Take back yesterday Did you ever think We could have come this far Did you ever think youd See right through the scars Can you believe its out there Its your will to win Things well keep forever Let the war begin We never let it die We always steal the show Never ones to wait around Now the world will know Sometimes in our lives We all have the need Sometimes giving up All our hopes and dreams Concentrate your anger Release all of the pain Get back all you lost Take back yesterday

"A provocation to loneliness, when all the best ends up into a grand march that doesnt fit you. Insisting looks and cheap perfumes on trampled sidewalks are aggressions that I wont answer to. I try, I swear, I doubt, I fail, I tried, I tried, I tried. Just another witness aint seen it coming. I was sitting there and yes I could still watch silhouettes dancing, with some kind of interest. I aint seen it coming, month by month experimenting the distress of not seeing sense in the cadence of bodies. Im sitting back in a place and watching the world declining, slowly as a granpa. All wrinkles drawn with millions of shoes used on the side of complacency. Its simply not for me. I tried to give it all sense. I tried to love perfume again. I tried to give it all meaning. I tried to remember. In the morning of my world, all loved has ceased. And in the end it is only you, me and the violence, with no kinda limitation. Before the death of all hearts, when all love will cease, the hope is saving. Give me a way to see clear into this foggy sea. Slowly we walk to the end of our dreams."

He couldnt pay the bills so he moved his family In a cheap apartment near a wast refinery They didnt know their water was infected with the slime That they dump into the water barrels at a time A deadly reaction sets forth A hazardous mutation to end all creation is born Pitiless fluid corroding like acid Flesh torn! Whose skins unprotected will soon be infected Be warned Radiation is spreading Human lives are ending No one can stop this Mutated race of the damned Across infected lands In a panic he ran screaming From his wife and kids The image burned into his mind Of their corroded limbs As the smell of rotting flesh Begins to attract flies They knew that they could never Return to their normal lives

"You gave me something that had no use All the empty words and thoughts I somehow still cling to Will you bear witness now to the scars youre opening and left by you? So, is your life one big excuse? Are the seeds youve sewn the one thing keeping you from the truth? A wise man learns from mistakes that others have made A fool betrays his own blood The truth is, you never saw it coming did you, no? Watch my patience, watch my trust run out You cant stop the hurt from all the people you love This broken tissue leaves not a bruise For the truth cuts much deeper than a blade sharpened by your news The hands of time have stolen every bit of my youth So tell me, whats left for me to abuse? When I get my thoughts together Ill find all the words to tell you not to come around again When words run out, you cant stop the hurt from all the people you love"

You teach us what was You teach us what was out there You teach us what was You teach us what was out there Lift our limbs to focus We soon drift through the night The getaway ... we drought the cloud of life A quick escape to velvet Start to drift in slumber. Smoke fills the velvet room No more options to cope. A glimpse of the hanging rope. Madness embrace the vault. Cannot wait any longer. A string of light blink ... mesmerize my senses A pulse that keeps me together for one last time No more options to cope. A glimpse of the hanging rope. Madness embrace the vault. Cannot wait any longer. A string of light blink ... mesmerize my senses A pulse that keeps me together for one last time Lift our limbs to focus We soon drift through the night You teach us what was You teach us what was out there You teach us what was You teach us what was out there Travel through a string of tears Screams crash down like waves Flushing my mind of a new world Afraid to open my eyes Climb the hill of the wrist ... enter oblivion Oblivion Foreshadow the Shadow My last exhale... Knees crash down on... Now rewind You teach us what was You teach us what was out there You teach us what was You teach us what was out there What once was...
"Devourment of ghost Sacrifice in homage to reject this mercy Cruelty to consume the vitality beneath the flesh Legacy of the funeral Allow this body of the soulless to be raised as great gate Channeling the chambers of blood to bring his rebirth Shaping this myth within a lunatics mind No forgiveness attained Alive within this altar of flesh Forever to be this restraint in promised pain Veins are emptied and embalmed with the appetite of betrayal Speechless lips are removed to invoke the words of the dead Infestation of belief that promised broken lies These ties with the unholy came true before these eyes Take these hands of betrayal and succumb to the defiance of death Lying in the arms of the sick, kissing this seduction of spilling blood The reality in promised faith now lies imprisoned in dark shrines Breathing out these streams of blood, this horror grows inside These fears await the butchers knife On wings of steel a soul will rise Methods of enslaving of the absolute For the degrading of eternity Blessed in the grasp of desecrated rites This fearless journey to resurrect Upon countless years weve died Etched scars in the skin of the attained The lifeless reborn once again Addiction in this infernal flame Surface this unclean soul as mouths of the underworld speak through wounds The regeneration of silenced pureness is strangled by intestines In halls of the confined this silence dies By avenging screams seeds of life cease Amnesty in the corrupt This black consumes the mind The paleness of the eyes This sight is content in submergence Emerged from stripped flesh Arise from the shell of god Flood waters of the baptized engulfing life to give birth to the cold of hell Self indulgence in the creation of perverse fear Hands now made tools of surgery Sinister ways of salvation Dissection of this savior Released from the calling of sighs Succumb to this arrogance in these words that dominate Blood runs beneath these eyes Entrance to the skull we find sickness of life Now march to the sounds of funeral cries"

No, lets make a mess No, lets make a baby No, lets make some hell on earth Do you mind if I turn out the lights? If Im going to be alone Id rather do it in the dark So I stare at half of a beer, half wishing that the transmission would stay in park She keeps the music down, so her neighbors dont complain Keeps the drama up, so she doesnt forget the pain I keep my momentum inside the reaction And hide my pride inside of my laughter It goes [Hook] [Verse 2 Slug] And Ill never forget the day you woke up To find a whole different world underneath your socks Forgot to check your pockets before you the checked the cost Yes maam, I saw the sign. No maam, I couldnt stop Drop off, now look who got water on the lawn Whatever it takes to calm your tongue If this living room fills with any more faults Im going to cut my finger, Im going to paint these walls If anybody watched us, theyd probably call the cops Because its obvious that neither one of us can adjust Discussion becomes disgust If luck was a lady I doubt she would save me from the bumrush Enough is enough, but how much is too much? Why am I still just a sheep to your touch? Why cant I ever fall asleep at dusk? Why do I need to see everything crushed? Its a big map girl, its yours if you ask If it dont wash up to the shore you wont discover it Instead, you can hide it in your head with that other shit And swallow it to chase and follow the suffering But Im still smiling, still up to no great Still trying to relocate Somewhere Imma find some work that matters Til then all you get is my smirk and my laughter It goes [Hook]"
Where are you going baby With your eyes so bright? You aint gonna visit your momma At this time of night Youre not gonna see your sister She lives too far away And not the next door neighbour Shes been away all day Tell me a story Like you always do Another little story Ill believe it too You stand there in the doorway And fill me with you lies Your painted lips are smiling But theres that look in your eyes I know theres someone waiting Out there in the dark But as long as you come home to me Ill be an easy mark Tell me a story Think up something new Another little story The best you can do

"Ive never been a rich kid Im glad I can say that Parents have debt they have to add up to pay back But I benefit from never havin a Maybach I remember feelin very affluent way back As a young kid when the money felt bigger Havin 5 dollars kinda felt like five figures And I thought that I could buy an entire aisle at Best Buy, yeah But is that the best idea? I wanted the new toy or game on the shelf Seeking the fleeting joy that came from the wealth They mass market products and exploit cheap labor To make toys we forget about a week later And we didnt even like em that much when we bought em But we had to have it cause our neighbors just got em Listen to the melody, money it aint the enemy But it just aint the remedy, damn it I know Ill never be [Chorus Lorde] And well never be Royals Royals It dont run in our blood That kind of lucks just aint for us We crave a different kind of buzz Let me be your ruler ruler You can call me queen bee And baby Ill rule Let me live that fantasy Hiphop has a history of glorifying riches It evolved in response to impoverished conditions And as kid hearing the message I didnt get it Not something I experienced but JayZ said it If you grew up with holes in your zapatos Youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough So while some rappers focus on material concepts You cant rob people of historical context And Im next in the line of those who coopt flows Hop to shows, rock the clothes but do not know Whats its like lookin down the barrel of a firehose Whats like calling one room your entire home So who am I to complain, its madness My high school was underfunded but we still had classes They taught me facts so I learned to stay true and And be a humble man too, like my friend Andrew Right Drew? You gotta know what it takes to succeed We dont have to be royals, we have what we need [Chorus]"

"I never forgot the time i lost faith in this a lost journey of many years, my heart has been torn in twain but still i stand and here i shall remain, with a feeble mind and a sea of lies dragging me to the depths of false beliefs, i seek the answer, the search will consume me until i sleep and perhaps dream of such a reality. shame lurks within my soul, in my tortured dreams, but im free from the shackles of ignorance, right now! i am free! i am drowning in unhallowed waters, merely a hollow vessel of existence, merely a vessel of existence. looking through faithless eyes, am i afraid to die ? are you afraid to die ? i will remember, when the skies are clear, i will remember, when my death is near, will you remember, the faith i had in you ? will you remember ? when my time has come."

"[Intro J. Sumbi] May I have your attention please The following is a brief introduction to the concept of the sunshine men Keep in mind that all instances that follow are fact and now our anthem [Verse 1] Recently Ive seen MCs comin thru While was at home, on my couch, watchin the boob tube Fightin like a rough neck, just to stay loose As I sat and wrote rhymes on a page like mother goose This was the problem, results of a test The heart of all wackness, lies rooted out west Right smack dab inside my civilization The hunt for an MC brings investigation What I mean is basically theres no one Who comes off correct and stands in the sun Of Cal., but here comes the change up in trend The world debut intro to the Sunshine Men [Sunshine, sunshine] [Sunshine, sunshine] [I dont understand] [Verse 2] Let me explain this, clearly and plain About the journey of the brothers who missed this train Towards sellout When I profile rhymes go straight out the window Were not like regular bimbos Were sunshine men Just a definition of those in this hot spot who despise the system One composed of an inferior peer group Pollutin the airwaves and I got the scoop On radio, its all about your cash flow Pay for airplay, or you fly solo Only one brother can come up off this Those without talents, but big drug profits Rap becomes a tool often used in vain Just like a gun When they want out of the insane lifestyle But they want the insane pay So they pick up a mic, yet they have nothing to say Its a damn shame, cause they form the pack Of those who represent my spot, yet they lack The skill to get raw with words and cold shoot em Stuck in the past, puttin raps to a drum computer Not even worried that the songs not able Cause they got juice and hookups at big labels No uniqueness, no goals or dreams No creativitys exactly how it seems As a sunshine man, with plans and a pen in my hand Recordin thoughts and beats for the next man Even those who live without a clue I bring the truth to you, its not new To help my cause, the rise or inflation The incline of western civilization Words to enlighten and to direct Brought to you live and correct From Sunshine Men [I understand] [Sunshine, sunshine] [Sunshine, sunshine] [Sunshine, sunshine] [Some depositions, with a few more useful words] [Verse 3] Why in the world is every one down with sunshine? None of them from here, but the attitudes clear They stroll like kings, the big fish in a small stream Too weak to battle so they fled the big apple And they moved out west like old settlers Booty MCs, no rhymes, with a swelled head Aimin to discover an inactive rhyme zone Just like Columbus, they called here home So they moved in and started a new trend West Coast stars made from East Coast pollution Native MCs never got the game plan So they grabbed the trumpets and hopped in the band But no, not me, neither I, nor D? Seeks to shade from sunshine Underneath trees of confusion Because this illusion is grim We choose to stay clear minded As sunshine men [Sunshine, sunshine] [Sunshine, sunshine] [Sit back and recline and watch the sunshine] [Sunshine, sunshine] [Sunshine, sunshine] [Sit back and recline and watch the sunshine]"

I did too. Love can grow from the last grain Its hard for me to love myself right now, Ive waited, hated, blamed it all on... You... I need you...less and less... Every day feeds this moral decay Yet I have grown to love you even more I fall back, and I turn another cheek. You mouth the words youre not ready to speak Youre scared of me now no I never had a clue That Id become so much stronger than you. I will take what you have for me now, if its not too late If you like, I will leave I will not miss the last train again Its hard for me to love myself right now, Ive waited, hated, blamed it all on you... Its hard for me to love your face right now Im waiting, hating, needing being Me... I need you...less and less... Every day leads us farther away... From that moment It hard for me to hate myself right now Finally Im understanding me One day we may have whole new mes and yous But first I need to learn to love me too..."

How to overcome it all And never lose the hope Heading for tomorrow A break along the walk To raise your head and go on... Hear the call of A distant thunder Theres a voice in the sky Evening falls weighing On your shoulders Like your feelings inside..."

"We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isnt a reality yet. Today, women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change. Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect. Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal? These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities"

You say, Only if you raise your hand and never hit me. Rule number 3 Even if you dont practice it Tell him you are a virgin and youre all about abstinence You aint having sex cause your parents aint having it Your moms is real strict and your dad will have a fit And if you say that and he stays on the line Keep him around for a while He might be worth your time [Niece Blueprint talking] N Thats really good uncle B Thank you, thank you..

They dont see what lies beneath, they dont see me. I peer through your eyes, wearing your flesh as a disguise. You can see too. You witness your life rotting through and through, I am the demon that lives inside you. Im feeding on you, devouring every aspect of your life. Hell. Im fucking your wife, Im fucking your wife as you cry in the corner. You wont exist much longer. Losing control, trapped in your head. Take your pills and tuck yourself into bed.

Ill grind you up so the pigs can eat you."

"In the night the world is changing, do we know who seized control ? Their lives are planned,theres no tomorrows, memories are held in dreams. Do they know that I remember ? In the crowd but all alone. I stand watch the changing skyline, oppressors crushed,theyre now aware. Beneath a steel sky, no ones asking why, no one sees a new tomorrow. The watchers in the park,the demons of the dark. Who beg steal or borrow ? I need to find a childhood memory, leave behind the distant shore. I find the door in the horizon, a world contained inside a shell."

"It is myth That Amazons chopped off one breast To make room for the strap of the labyrice It is not a myth that womyn sacrifice, nor that bodies are inconvenient Sometimes, we surrender the feminine for the fight, shift the weight of progress to our hips And balance guns like babies That is no myth, that is survival My father once said he believed myth propagated the species That the urge to believe was mostly stronger than belief itself and so survival Was belief in myth The lump in my sisters breast has led her to believe that her breasts are unreliable Still, she would rather have two She wonders who would be qualified to erase one half of her And what sort of weapon they would choose My father was the first to suggest That lesbianism was a weapon. He said For the most part, bodies are inconvenient, at least lesbian bodies are political. It was convenient that I found breasts lovely My sister asks if she would be lovely with only one breast. I tell her yes That bodies are political, I tell her yes, that sacrifice is progress. She tells me yes, that is your myth. She tells me this is my survival."

"Boundless water in an eternity frame of mind And all thats lost is our time Peaks break through open sky that grasps for land below Mountains climb and topple on themselves Steel breaks wave and sounds lull us to sleep All things drift quietly away... Forget your cell phone man, it wont work here Forget your cell phone man, it wont work here It wont work here It wont work here It wont work here My cameras zoom it captures all that might embrace it Unsteadied ice creates the wake in deeper places Oh darling, I cant bare the thought of separation The years will pass and well forget of how this made us There is substance in this silence The proof of what surrounds us Photographs are a mirror image Look deep and see yourself in them Seasickness, ancient forests, and water creatures Keep us from thinking about home"

"Blood gushes from the wound The cut is wide and deep And before I turn around He falls to his knees A clear song rings in the blade When steel meets hardened steel. I hear the sound of wood that breaks, A swords cuts through my shield. I drop the shield and grab my axe, A weapon in each fist. The first blow makes the helmet crack, The axe cut to the teeth. I rip the axe from the head, covered in blood and brains. Leave the body lying dead, Ready to strike again. My sword cuts through clothes and skin, Like a hot knife cuts through snow. I smile as the bastard screams, when I twist my sword. Sword in my hand, Axe on my side. Valhall awaits, Soon I will die. Sword in my hand, Axe on my side. Valhall awaits me, When I die. Bear skin on my back, Wolf jaw on my head. Valhall awaits me When Im dead. I raise my axe above my head, My eyes stare in furious rage. Yet more blood will be shed, This is a victorious day! Blood gushes from the wound, The cut is wide and deep. As I turn around, I fall to my knees. Sword in my hand, Axe on my side. Valhall awaits, Soon I will die. Sword in my hand, Axe on my side. Valhall awaits me, When I die. Bear skin on my back, Wolf jaw on my head. Valhall awaits me When Im dead."

"[Verse One] I awoke to the sound of rushing water Brushing off the remains of sleep like dry leaves in the plush of autumn Almost forgot the dream from where I was so recently engaged As members of my house so ritualistic began their days So once assured I could rest on my day off An inner smile guided me back to that necessary nod off And once again I became a bottle nose that played Riding amid the waves in a graceful oceanic display On an emotional plain, more colorful than Crayons Emitting sounds of joy as well as sounds of navigation Using echo locations, similar to that of winged mammalians Searching for some food I ran into a sea reptilian Who said she had mind power, taught to her by the Anunnaki To speak to my grandfather with technique like a walkietalkie Of what she was talking I knew nothing about of course But as she spoke I felt vibrations indicating a greater source Then I ever experienced Curious, I urged her to continue Learning of this water world I thought I knew And matters of my destiny presenting these thoughts anew The last thing she said was, Do not fear death As it would only take me through Do not fear death? What? [Verse Two] Then suddenly as if on queue a dark cloud was moving near me And the ancient ones eyes grew wide and I knew that I must hurry Moving quickly, I hardly had enough time to gasp As I glanced back, the sight of a fading turtle was my last Swallowed by the cloud though I could still feel her presence Trying to figure out what it all meant, seemed so senseless But endless the ocean was not so I knew this thing Id see again Do not fear death she said Inside my soul those words would never end They never end [Verse Three] Then I awoke to the sound of careless chatter As the clock radio beside my bed took a dagger to my subconscious Tearing dreams to shreds, I shook my head trying to remember what adventures I partook and why it felt like something entered My heart and soul like I had shared my deepest secrets But I just couldnt recall where Id gone or what Id seen Then reaching for the radio switch, my heart skipped a beat When the words Ocean tanker pulled my ear into its speech On a coral reef it seems a tanker ship got caught while cruising Damaged its hull and poured from it a chemical solution A deadly pollution not intended for consumption But into the living water poured this dark cloud of obstruction How strange it felt for me to be so deeply affected Even though a love for Earth I had already accepted I couldnt help but feel a pain more sharply directed Marking some unexpected connection The words selected were Do not fear death It was an entrance to my memory Do not fear death It was an exit for an entity Do not fear death The words made sense and yet they didnt Do not fear death she said [Sample] I had a crazy little dream, when I woke up I found"

"Down on the football place I saw my sister burning They tied her on a railroad track And made her blue eyes burning Her dog was sitting by her feet The whole night he was howling In dirty pants the judge came down Slavering his golden gown Yes, she was the one Who turned the rain into black The television vulture ... They brought my sister to trial Cutting her face from her smile On the holy waterfront The people stand there waiting To see her blonde hair lighted To see her blood drip on the floor"

Night Never was your friend Nervousness on end You cant comprehend Why it makes you scream Outside Murder on the street You cant go to sleep So instead you dream Dream your last dream And when the night is here The end is near Its your final hour Cause everything dies Where darkness lies Despite All that you believe You will still receive The fate of the nave Darkness at your door Inside You will try to hide But you will be denied The perfect suicide Who could ask for more And when the night is here The end is near Its your final hour Cause everything dies Where darkness lies And when the night is through Therell be nothing left of you Except your cold remains To wake the light of day Night Never was your friend Nervousness on end You cant comprehend Why it makes you scream Outside Murder on the street You cant go to sleep So instead you dream Dream your last dream And when the night is here The end is near Its your final hour Cause everything dies Where darkness lies
"Get up from the rest. I thought I would die from it Live outside of myself but inside somethin My realitys a form of my judgements Try nothing, and come out of it triumphant Forming edges in the circles I run in I approach thought like I would approach five gunmen Carefully. Like hunters that find covens In the woods. Would finalize what my mind summons Back to where I could never just sit and decide something As I slip within my minds suction I venture deeper inside it until I find something Guides from the cow manure, a source of divine substance A cow ass led to my minds success If that isnt humbling I dont know what is I love sustenant substances, trying to find confidence the one I havent done yet Cant wait until Im ash up in a cubic urn, having conversations with the master of the universe Until then, my lifes a stanza in a stupid verse As a topic, Im one that the manic mannered do converse Spell my name, thats a spell where magic do occur Im a state of space alike one where the suns left My lifell end as cliche as a sunset Always doing more just to find I couldve done less But if Id done less, I know it probably wouldnt have been enough But if Id done less, I know it wouldnt have been enough But if Id done less, I know that it wouldnt have been enough"

"Heal me. Break this pattern. This neverending stream of hopelessness Just as soon as I start to stand I am pulled back down to a crawl I almost feel nothing at all. All the time I just feel so small I cant accomplish anything when it all seems so pointless and the end makes the means not worth it at all Conscious saturation, selfish allegation, moving inside and breaking through the veins in the mold As I walk without aim down the streets of anywhere I see in shallow puddles an atrophied soul and a vacant stare Some day itll find you No one gets away from this so easily Do you have any heart? Do you have a conscience? They were so powerless and fragile ...they didnt have to go but your cowardice and senseless lusts took hold and brought you to hurt So few of us left to see them as theyre put into the earth You took them all and Im left to push on Does everyone truly die alone? I hope you die alone The next time you see my face it wont be recognizable The next time you hear my voice you wont even know its there And when you reach out to touch my face I hope the cold bites at your skin And as you cringe and stuff it down, youll know just what went wrong Kill me. Break this pattern. This neverending stream of heartlessness Just as soon as I start to stand I am pulled back down to a crawl I really feel nothing at all. All the time I just feel so small"

"Moments, comments Then one thing that you said Did it again Turned our world upside down again I surprised you I surprised myself Is this what we need I dont wanna stop I can do this, I am ready I know I can do this I dont really wanna stop this I can love you like no other, I can Ready for love, I feel fine I feel just fine Do I ask too much Rebounded, founded What I hope is missing in me Ill admit this is new to me Did I catch you at a bad time Do I ask too much I dont wanna stop I can do this, I am ready I know I can do this I dont really wanna stop this I can love you like no other, I can Ready for love, I feel fine I feel just fine Ready for love I surprised you I surprised myself Is this what we need I dont wanna stop I can do this, I am ready I know I can do this I dont really wanna stop this I can love you like no other, I can Ready for love, I feel fine I feel just fine Ready for love"
"Sometimes I feel myself living at the back of beyond Beyond the light, beyond the reason When nerves do not feel the rush of the wind When the rustle of grass cant be heard Worms gnaw my skin Worms gnaw my soul Roots covers my members And pull me in depths of the womb of the Earth Dawn is openings the gates of life Opening the heights of barrows Dawn is openings the gates of life Revealing secrets of the wood The face of an idol in the reflections of the light Plunging into shadow and cold Leaving for eternity and oblivion"
"I love your apple I know your shape And what youre for My solitary Is down below your shaded warmth You see right through me Do you know what Im thinking? Is it pain is it love That keeps us growing stronger than anyone Am I just an amazing freak of nature tired of going on? I found I am unlike you I found I am unlike you Been a stranger for the last time, in my room For what are you reaching Youre growing higher every year Maybe for heaven To take you away from us my dear Is this theory absurd? I know you will be staying right here"
"He Is The Beast In Black Lurking The Night, In The Shadows To Attack When You Wonder Where Your Children Went Murder! Torture! Dismemberment! He Is The Beast That Walks The Night Feasting On Children, Taking Pleasure In Their Cries The Hand Of Black Will Strike Once Again Wolfen Hunger That Ravels In Its Pain Beast In Black Your Soul Is Damned Forever"
"[Verse 1] Prepare for this galeforce Drapht, be warned of this wind Entering your body through the pores of your skin Sing for a purpose, battle the worthless Wounds I inflict cant be fixed by doctors or nurses I surface from this land down under Strike with the speed of light when I ride with the force of thunder Run for cover man, you better run quick Cause like reptile, acid flows when I spit Got a bone to pick like a vulture on a corpse Intent to harm with my hypnotic force Travel through a time warp, a hired assassin Go for days on end without a supply of rations A strong passion to punish, crave the taste So sick I turn stomachs so you better stay away fuck off!

What a shame, I use my mind for evil Paralyse those who think were fucking equal The sequel seeps out your speakers, an invasion Only thing left I lack in life is patience Leash the devastation, nation on their toes Sleeping through dreams in the form of a crow Deformed they arose, my army from the grave The trait that makes words that are sharper than blades Invade your space, cant hard in your disguise Wack spies stand out more than fat chicks thighs [Hook] Dont underestimate, Im here to devastate Cant trust no one in this world full of renegades Get my pen and page, I aim for centre stage Ill avenge, recommend it will end that way It will end that way, Im here to devastate Cant trust no one in this world full of renegades Get my pen and page, I aim for centre stage It will end that way, its gotta end that way [Verse 3] A survivor stuck in a storm, washed up to shore Whats around the corner? Never know whats in store Open a wrong door and its back to the start But if you got a pocket of cash, then the dogs wont bark Ooh thats life in this world of corruption Moneys the fuel that drives hell suction Ill tell you something, every man to himself I dont trust no one when it comes down to wealth no one Its just me in this black and white picture It must be that this role dont fit ya Execute with scripture, no life to spare Take the law in my hands, burn like electric chairs Its rare, you cant compare, so prepare As I propel through the air, dont give a fuck about fair Im the one that makes up my mind Believe it or not, Ill achieve what I want with time Nine out of ten times Ill break the rules Extend rhymes to bend spines, my tongues my tool Some say its cool, I got the jeweller ?abdulger bar? Life will end up in a full body cast Shattering bones with the tone of my words From Perth, an omen, I was chosen from birth Explode on purpose, this mission is complete Seek with defeat, the taste of revenge was sweet"
A father and child in delirium Vomit wrenched from the infants gullet Smeared across the stone floor As penance and sacrifice The paupers emaciated form With hollow eyes Gazes to the bastion With toxic words He is bathed in gold Bones are buried beneath satin Bread and meat are left to rot In ritual catatonia Carry my burdens of dreams and longings Watch in ecstasy The procession of retrogrades To the waiting of grinding teeth Starving bowels Cast aside the feast And burn for the semen of magnates

"[Intro] Normal... I dont know I dont know what normal is I thought I did once I dont anymore [Verse 1 HiRez] I know what its like to have to wake up in the morning and go do something that you dont like I know what its like to wake up sad and depressed and question if its worth livin your life I know what its like to get stressed out every single night, having panic attacks I know what its like to think your homey was your homey, turn around and get stabbed in the back I know what its like to have to put in overtime and double shifts every night just so you can get by I know what its like to have a loved one get locked up, and see a couple close friends die I know what its like to see your parents fight every night, struggling to get out of debt I know what its like to wish you could go back in time and undo all the things you regret [Chorus CHEL] The weight of the world is on my shoulders Im fighting a war that starts within The weight of the world is on my shoulders Im wounded but I know I can win [Verse 2 HiRez] I know what its like doing things that you shouldnt, but it helps to take the pain away, so you just keep on doing it I know what its like being hungry as shit, aint no money in your wallet, aint no food in the crib I know what its like to feel different and alone, even in a crowded room full of people that you know I know what its like to see a grown man cry, because his own son died and I just asked god why I know what its like to get so damn high, on a couple different things at the same damn time I know what its like to have the whole world say you changed I know what its like to go insane I know what its like getting death threats everywhere that you go I know what its like to live on the road I know what its like to go from broke to rocking designer clothes I know what its like to not trust these hoes [Chorus CHEL] The weight of the world is on my shoulders Im fighting a war that starts within The weight of the world is on my shoulders Im wounded but I know I can win [Outro] Theres a huge motivation behind my lyrics and my work and what I do, is, you know, not being able to necessarily be comfortable. Its a balancing act. Its nearly impossible and I feel like its going to kill me before I even find it. You know what I mean?"
"Take time think about when its over And when i see you wheres your line I cannot hear all the truth through Your crying Its time that i check my face Faggot, you know it The sun in my face Forced my grin Theeth shining, with dimples Kill away the lust It happens way too often Eyes closed and mouth forced open You always seem confused Hands up and now you proved That when You kick my ass But please dont hit my face So i can laugh Hey faggot Wheres your friends cause you know That you cant hide Alone You know youre shit so Hit him in the face, in the face Come on do it again In the face, in the face Come on do it, hit him In the face, in the face Come on do it Again and again, and again It happens way too often Eyes closed and mouth forced open You always seemed confused Hands up and now you proved That when You kick my ass But please dont hit my face So i can laugh Fuck you Stop grinning Fix your eyes kid Wipe that shit off your face Look away boy Stop starin Stop grinning Stop laughing No doubt you would all tear me limb From limb should i ever Relinquish this control...

"Fueled by the foulness from my poisoned wound slowly turning to the dark side of the fjord. No return to the daylight. My future is set sharp axes await. I deal death with an axe and a torch. I see souls as they wander in the bleakness. Behind great trees and in the deep seas. The past, now, and in the future. The task you gave me when we met still haunts me. The burning oak sap is dripping, branches creaking and dying. This is the last you will ever hear from me. A silent letter written in ash on a tomb stone. The wandering souls await my presence. Smoke my ashes and let me be present."

Our life is... What should it be then? A way to go down and way to up... Again Another way for my escape Another day to lose my domain We keep playing our funny games... Our life is... Do you know it better than me? Im not sure if I even want to know So the life is... This puzzle is missing one piece Another way for me to embrace Another one to hold my mask in place Where should I start... I see... When our innocence was lost I see... And emotions turned to violence I see... Do you have my missing piece I see... Could you build me... Complete I was thinking life as a game Deal the cards Play it to the end So you get all the money And all the fame Some things are more than eye can see Some things are not meant to be seen When our innocence was lost Emotions turned to violence So many of us are waste of flesh and skin Open your eyes! Another way to say Another way to feel Another way see What is under the filth...
I turn to go Are you there? Watching me So sad So sad When I call Are you there? Say you were Say...
"You know me Im a one man army with more then a trick up these sleeves So nothing ever gonna stop me You should know you Life comes at you fast And its gonna take all you got To make it last You brought me Under your wings Only to shelter me From my true destiny Settle not for less It only makes you stronger We live as sinners Pretty day you make it big Soon, fear with remorse As the pillars of your temple Collapse and hear your assets cry As they burn alive You know me Im so much more than this I will bite the hand that feeds me And bring fear into man eyes One thrust two thrust It never stops I can never be the man I was before It came down to this."
Yes I know the secret Thats within your mind You think all the people Who worship you are blind Youre just like me brother Giving up your trust And when you have played enough Youll just cast our souls Into the dust Into the dust You thought that it would be easy From the very start Now Ive found you out I dont think youre so smart I only have one more question Before my time is through Please I beg you tell me In the name of hell Who are you? Who are you?
"Is the flame going to last With all this cold inside my chest? My fading soul can never rest Emptiness has filled my past My dying kingdom Forever cursed with solitude My happy ending Has failed since I Havent found you Havent found you Havent found you Havent found you A single voice inside my head Begs the strength that once I had My bitter tears fall in my bed Where my dreams are lying dead My dying kingdom Forever cursed with solitude My happy ending Has failed since I Here I stand in these dead remains Of what once used to be a man Cant clean all these dirty stains Cant clean it Here I stand in these dead remains The curse is done Of what once used to be a man The sun has gone Cant clean all these dirty stains And now Im alone Cant clean it In my dying kingdom From the same source I have not taken my sorrow I could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone And all I loved, I loved alone Edgar Allan Poe My dead empty eyes reflect despair inside Struggling with the pain that follows me my whole life As my perspectives die the sun no longer shines Shadows embrace these lone forsaken sights My dry lifeless heart has petrified with time I cant break through these walls to see the other side As I stare the remains Im inert to the rain Feels like falling over and over again Here I stand in these dead remains Of what once used to be a man Cant clean all these dirty stains Cant clean it Here I stand in these dead remains The curse is done Of what once used to be a man The sun has gone Cant clean all these dirty stains And now Im alone Cant clean it Here I stand in these dead remains The curse is done Of what once used to be a man The sun has gone Cant clean all these dirty stains And now were alone Cant clean it"

Hello, my name is John nice to meet you Hello John, whats the prob? We know that we can treat you I never thought Id end up talking at one of these meetings But Ive really been feeling like theres something in me bleeding My freedom is receding and the bars are closing in And the jig is almost up like cop cars are closing in Oh here we go again, another criminal confession Shh. Keep it down, Im trying to listen to his message Yes! Its a message and Im trying to teach you something Ive been running from this pain but obstructions got me bumping Into bad memories, old enemies and whatnot I could never get away like I was tied to a cement block Regardless Ill pull until I make it to my destination Not even a sec of rest or hesitation Because my brother needs some care for too My only hope is there is someone that can care for you [Hook Mouthmatics] I look down and I see that we all have grown up from children now I had a backbone but thats gone I have to only pretend to now My conscience keeps telling me that Im gonna reinvent you now Its amazing, the changes lately that take place from then to now [Verse 2 Mouthmatics] Weve grown up so much in the last year Recovering from such a disaster I used to rely on my pastor right? But the man passed away just two weeks tonight. Thats right! But I cant lose faith, I gotta move on Bills are building, gotta get my groove on Adult now. When the hell did that happen? I used to be a kid when started this rapping I used to have a dad in the house that I live in My momma used to be too but couldnt forgive him A place without parents is a teenage dream But when the years go by things became unseen Start to realize that I wanted the company From the family because they showed so much love for me Hopefully my actions will match my words Find the good from the bad like gold from dirt And I know it seems like itll never work And I know youre in the back but you deserve to be first Its time to move on, I can show you how Its time to move on from then to now [Hook Mouthmatics] I look down and I see that we all have grown up from children now I had a backbone but thats gone I have to only pretend to now My conscience keeps telling me that Im gonna reinvent you now Its amazing, the changes lately that take place from then to now [Bridge Mouthmatics] Grown up from children now Only pretend to now Gonna reinvent you now Alright everybody in the house, stand up, sing it From then to now Lets go, everybody in the house [Hook Mouthmatics] I look down and I see that we all have grown up from children now I had a backbone but thats gone I have to only pretend to now My conscience keeps telling me that Im gonna reinvent you now Its amazing, the changes lately that take place from then to now"

On your knees Praying at the burial ground Mistrustful eyes of intimacy Pointing the way to the other side You hear the screams of a million souls Unguarded and left to their own resources Where time turned into a frozen block And even the water of life You will die! Wander in the valley As you reach for the sky With hollow shells of faded dreams Time bomb ticking has just begun To make reprisals on what I have done Like grains of sand that fall from my hand The fate I feel is drawing near Shackles in my brain losing so fast Waiting to unfold Mummified bodies Elixir of life wasting away Perpetual glares of those who are delivered Entomber in the derbis of honour and blood A sinful voice that prophesied Death becomes easy just close your eyes Incantation of freedom so urgent and true Your wish is my command

"Even until now lives a settled conviction, that salvation can be bought here, on the Earth, by praying the so called offering to the priest of grace. For centuries the human naivety has been used by the Catholic Church to debauch its stomach and magnify its fortune. Bargaining the salvation is just another hypocrisy of the Catholic Church, and since money is the instrumentum daiboli, where really hides the Beast? And that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name. I cleanse my body in the bloodred crystal sea Bestial amok lasts Pure soul, pale flesh, icecold breath Altar prepared, whiteness clean, golden candlesticks Chalices in diamonds, the smell of incense Innocent souls, naive children Vulgar herd awaits salvation Ive sold my soul to the truth Life path winding, but free I let it flow in harmony With nature, my animal humanity. Another bell tolls for the hour of coming Another chime of lies Odour of hypocrisy and false saints The Lord is coming Lord of Hosts Black not heavenly Open thee soul Figures dissolved by my eyesight Wax nobility Flour and water raised above Grape drink tastes like blood Shawls of mendacity White bread and flesh Hands folded in triangle Sign of the cross Sacrifice fulfilled."

"Battleships are leaving port, They are heading north, Squadrons of cruisers are coming forth, The cold Norwegian fjords await. Trained in the Baltic sea, They head for a destiny, Less glorious than it was set out to be, Ice cold Norwegian fjords await, The water shines so crystal bright Led by the moon this beautiful night, When the nigh time dawns and the mist comes The Iron Monster glides into the Northern Shores. Lanterns are shut, but the ship is spotted, From Rauy fort, the alarm goes off. A threat to our nation is in our waters, At 0421 the first bomb of Oscarborg is shot. Smoke fills the ship, As fuel and ammunition catches fire, 51 shots on the starboard side, Torpedoing the Blcher entirely. Soldiers are burned and choked by smoke, Thrown overboard in the fjord so cold, A thousand German soldiers die this April 9th. The exquadrare is turning, As they see how their mothership is burning, They set full retreat, In this battle they suffer Defeat!"

"Abnormal carnal desires, Execute the priests bidding, Offers the halfdead tissues, And entrails yet are living, Deadly teeth, of the beast, venom streams, Pierce your flesh, at the strike, of midnight, The spattered sword of fire, Soaked with gouts of blood, Black snakes swarmed the soil, Fierce horns of Hecate entwined Steven Rathbone Guitars, Lead Vocals Donald James Barraca Bass Larry Herweg Drums"
"Welcome to the masquerade. Were all pretending just to make it through the day. What we do must never come to light. Dwelling in the dark for whats wrong feels so right. Theyre gonna find us, theyre gonna find us at the dark end. Theyre gonna find us at the dark end. Im smashed into pieces living hour by hour Twenty four is too much to devour. My eyes where blind but these words are so sour. How does it feel to be alive? How does it feel to be alive? Here in my mind Ive died a thousand times. Dwelling in the dark for whats wrong feels so right. Hand in hand my friend This is the end. My head is like a cage without a key My thoughts run rampant. These words I dare not speak. In the shadows I wait and creep. Sever my tongue to silence my speech. So you may never lay eyes on this atrocity. Seeking refuge in the depths for what we are must never see the surface. So grim this game of skin were living in. Im not playing to win. Despair is where Ive made my bed Im not losing sleep. Hells inside my head! When God fails, the noose prevails!"

Ive learned to trudge lightly When judging others standing Cause my past wouldve got me banished By traditional justice standards How do I manage? I dont know All I know is that man can grow Some mistakes I might take to the grave But now I behave and thats the glow For those who dont deserve to learn Deserve chances to earn their word If they ruin em let em burn Maybe, if they lack concern But until that lines clearly crossed I cant be one to crucify How could I when Ive deeply hurt So many lives without losing mine To anyone Ive done wrong Whos listening to this track I sincerely apologize I wish that I could take it back but I cant I feel guilt I feel remorse I feel that And I hope you find the slightest peace In hearing Im a changed man Cause I am, yes I am A product of my environment A victim of the system From birth to retirement Please, please just listen I promise Ive inquired it Its been written in my system From birth to enlightenment I didnt come into the world a bad man I came in a bright aura like all babies do But I was birthed in a earth Resembling a trash can And I learned all the horror Like all babies do So when I say Im a victim of the system Im not trying to detract blame But if youre still here and youre still listening That is not how I came It was learned and its been owned It was burned and now Im home And Im thankful to have been able To learn from my mistakes and change Rather than being shot or locked and chained Only to be further displaced If I could Id apologize to your face But I dont know if I can so this is the least I could do"

The traveler arrived at the tribe of the brute siblings A hidden camp near the cliffs of the vandal mountains A beautiful maiden of the cloth cloaked in pagan norm She told of a plan to unite three tribes As her words were soft and warm The chief is old and tired puts trust to his son The future lies with him cause hes his only one She gets close and trusted and tells him of her kind Temptress of seduction she poisons his mind With her words she poisons his mind I will love and care for you until my dying breath I am scared and troubled I fear for your death If you remain a heathen a dark place you will go And we wont be together I feel that you know We will run away together thru the fog thru the trees We will leave our pasts behind never to be spoken They must know we are gone headed for the sea They will try to find us and bring us back again The tribe cannot believe that they would run away What were they thinking she will die this day The chief wants his son back spreads word thru the land He wants him safe and well but kill her where she stands Backed by the void of reasoning Brutal times rot to the core But the vibrance of the tyrants brought forth faith And they started a war We will run away together thru the fog thru the trees We will leave our pasts behind never to be spoken They must know we are gone headed for the sea They will try to find us and bring us back again They ran into asking the word has been spread And without warning they lopped off her head He drew his blade in anger he was told to yield He did not they broke his neck they hit him with a shield They hit him with a shield the vandals divide His son is dead.

"I step into a cave full of bats. Tired of the bloodthirsty hunt. With black leather wings of Hell. No mercy in my heart cold as death. But where is the coffin of my nest. Have the humans finally found me? Cursed be the flesh I have spared. You can hunt but never will you win....the Dark. I take the form of a funeral fog. Weird and full of tormented souls. Beware, superstitious mortals. With claws of black steel I slay. Pitiful herd with stakes and crosses. See what Evil breeds from hurting me. I spit on your efforts to destroy me. Your souls Ill soon possess..in the Dark."

"Follow the path towards the solitude, thou shall feel cursed if betrayed. But when I betray call the Martyr to weep, to bury the scars thru never ending seasons of grief, then Ill follow the black path towards horizon dark and Ill reach only sadness, as mourning dwells in me. Like a love lost in the cold, thru the grim shadows of old, shadows that whisper of souls. Like a love lost in the cold, that strength less I shall behold thru years of darkness or filtrate light, its always been easier to close the eyes, rather than open them and see what thou never ever wanted to see... Once felt the weight of thy age, call the Martyr to laugh and dance upon thy graveyard of shame. For love was lost and life was won, all the other things are shades to be gone and the path of mourning longs for more... Come here Mephisto, come here Mephisto, dance thy particular waltz upon my ridiculous grave. Spirit and flesh are now rotting, their abode is so far, shall I find it? For the path I am walking, its so lonely and bleeding, the griefs overwhelming and sadness is crying, thou can taste all my sorrow for my life is so empty, empty like words that are buried with loss. Turn on thy back all thats shown is regret and the shadows of death are unleashing their powers NOW! Like a love lost in the cold, thru the grim shadows of old, shadows that whisper of souls. Everything gone and never to return, heres the coldness and the bleakness of it all, a constant prelude to agony, a following of seasons of apathy, cruel are the eyes of misery, black are the wings of my destiny, primordial tears come out as knives... The left half of the heart in the left hand, the right half of the heart in the right hand... OBSCURITY Mourning dwells in me, Obscurity A lifelong misery, Obscurity bleeding the soul away... Feeling the dusk coming out from my bones, crushing everything that Im holding inside and then going back again... Feeling the dusk coming out from my bones, crushing everything I am holding inside and all left behind seem to come back again... When senses are blinded and feelings distorted call the Martyr to show thee the real true existence, hypnotic delusions are blessed with confusion, another landscape is silent with intent of revelation, groping ones way towards the wastes of life, why this seems to have no end? Groping ones way towards the wastes of life, please help me inhale the true existence!..."

"Framed inside the reflection of the mirror, I saw a perfect picture. The hands wont wait for you to save this, And I cannot go on pretending you feel the same. I am done tracing circles, repeating the past. This is the only way out. Trust me, this is the only way out. I have seen it all before and I cant make the same mistakes. I have seen this before, I should have seen it fucking coming. Its the same road with different scenery. But I couldnt see the forest from the wolves. This time I am not selling myself short again. If were in this, then were in this together. So what will it be? Framed inside reflections of the mirror I saw perfect picture... And I wanted this, the long nights on the floor, The long days underneath the red sky. And all I have said all I needed to say. Made myself clear, So Ill wait for the call, so what shall it be? Return to embrace or destroy? Ill wait for the call. The hands wont wait for you to save this."

Five or ten years from now I tell em, I wanna be this I wanna be that I wanna sell em this game, I want to show em that I can rap I came from game design, to keepin people from gettin jail time Now it all boils down to this one and only rhyme I say I want to get rich, but every time that I earn a dime I spend it I start a new chapter and I dont finish it This one dream, I would hate to diminish it But how can I accomplish it when I never finish shit! I always start somethin but I never finish I got a thick list that Im crumblin with my fist I take to heart something, but its only just a wish Cause I cant clearly see success lyin deep within the thick mist Unh!

Hook Verse 3 My mind has been pervaded by the mental invasion of lust Everyday, I masturbate just for the satisfaction All talk, but no action I only talk shit, but see, Im only just reacting Its to the point that I dont even like interacting As much as I used to Now I spend my days counteracting karma I dont have dogma Im only stuck with darhma Its a damn shame that everyday, I gotta put up with drama Do you know how it feels to be dissed? Do you know how bad it feels to know the many Opportunities youve missed? If you havent, dont think that you wont Youll find out soon enough, how rough life can get But anyway, Ill continue To dream of a day where everything will be okay Where I can find my spirit guide And show her that Ive survived The many burdens that life has placed upon us Unh!

"In the depths of our mind Sleeps all that weve left behind, All weve forgotten. And all that weve ever made Left a footprint in the universe, A certain energy. We gather what we send out And we keep it all. This is what we are, Darkness lies within. This is what we get, Thats blackened karma. Give a little destiny, Take away the pain. This is what weve got, Thats blackened karma. We are stuck to our fate And however we might try to run away, To turn around, We will have to pay the price, All we took away and all the bills weve left Unpaid in life."

"For years and years in this world I am living With infinite pain I swallow deep down inside, No one have known how much wounds I covered, No one have known how much I was tired. How can it be I am drowning in oceans Of deep agony that take me to edges With the weight of this fate on my shoulders, Asking myself to fall in this haze... Ive tried to search my hopes and my answers, Across this malignant reigns of sorrow and grief, I have seen so much gloom, desperation And the lights of the truth disappeared. Indeed i felt my spirit withering slowly, Cold autumn waves embraced entirely my being, My fragile wishes have called me to follow My inner wisdoms and my secret dreams... Ive tried to fight against my loneliness, I was always afraid to delusing someone, Ive slighted my real ideals and wishes And Ive lied to myself about my life... But Ive found just cold statues on my paths And my naivety became my eternal flaw, And soon I forget about my tenderness, And thunders of madness encircled my soul... Black fogs covered the sun of my existence, And the fallen leaves have frozen my heart, Asleep in the deepest agonal slumber, I am chained in the mirrors of loss... With every new fall I gain to this knowledges, With every new pain my being will fade, My sins and my failures will lead me to abyss, My journey will come to its unnatural end... .....this words are so cold ...... .....this beings are so wrong.... ......this pains are so old.......... .......this feelings are so strong... I drank alone my poison, Ive sit in depths of ashes... Ive withered in my darkness.... I burnt in my fancys flames... I fell in absence of myself, I travelled beyond sweet deceits, My world, lost and forgotten, Adrift adrift in ocean of sins. Im the cursed, the vagrant, Im silent in fire of doom, Oppressed by my inner damnation, Betrayed by my wounded lusts. My world is dying in indifference, In loveless oceans of lies, Theres no time for the changes... And I am I am so tired so tired to try ..."

"[Verse 1] A question ma sanity do I live in reality Or is it just a part of me, I am questioning actively It seems to be the start of something thats much more profound I can feel it in ma heart, my brain could only tell me now Is that a good sign or bad, all the good times Ive had Could all be fake and theres no way of even knowing that That could be a common fact, no point in lookin back A may as well just sit my self and slit my wrist with broken glass Question... Would you even stop me if I tried to dae that A hope not. Id be beggin hard to bring the pain back Cos pain is stress relief and stress, I can no longer handle Ill break the chains of strife and fade away like worn out candles I think I become different when I think a bit And Im sure Im smarter when I question shit A like to think if I was rich Id still be fighting for The people stuck in working class without a single pound at all But people tend to change as soon as cash can reach their pockets And if their charity aint lucrative, they feel have to drop it But I think Im different, fuck that, I know I am You can live your life, but av got morals of a broken man [Hook x2] What if a was born rich, would I think differently What if a was born in Israel, would the same shit still get to me What if a was born a different gender, would I think the same shit Theres too many what ifs [Verse 2] Askings easy answerings the hardest part I couldnt justify my life without the truth a life apart Am I a happy guy or good at making fake grins Just to stop the company am with thinking am hate filled Will I ever be successful or just stay skint? Im picking up the pieces of my life cos I can take hints I dont hold a grudge, or do I, time can always tell Im clueless, times the only thing that knows me well Will I be forgotten or can I be a timeless legend Can I beat my tracks of past, with all of my tracks of present? How can my life end, with violence or a peaceful sleep I get stronger every day, so I can beat the weak Do I question fairly, do I truly test myself Or do I make my life as simple as I can to end my hell And is that good enough, can I truly stand the test of time Or will I faily like every other cunt thats lived a life like mine"
"You can insert a comment marker in the text itself. This marker is not displayed. As text is being changed, the marker stay embedded in the text itself and moves around as text is being edited. If the paragraph is removed then the comment can be orphaned and garbage collected later. Of course, this has nothing to do with DBs, is just pure text processing If you want a DB centric approach then the paragraphs are assigned primary keys during creation and the comments reference this primary key. As PK, of course, they never change. Order of paragraphs within text can be persisted as a relation previouscurrentnext implemented as a separate table, or as nextid and previd fields. You can also throw in versioning history. Im not a editable text storage expert so I dont know what is the state of the art Your problem, as you state it, is not a problem of text processing but a problem arrise from the use of a natural primary key paragraph position or paragraph hash. Of course, we all know that natural keys are bad because they change. In your example they change very frequently. Using surrogate keys solve the problem of PK volatility. the rest is just a modeling exercise on storing the relations order of paragraphs in text, paragraph changes as text evolves etc. Im letting as an exercise to you the problem of paragraph split during edit which shard inherits which comments and the problem of paragraph merge"

"[VERSE ONE MC BREW] The morbid ill conform it Absorb it like hydrochloric On tissue with a misused language to kiss you Issues get addressed if the avoided conflict sticks A dry humorless hunch, thats how it started without a hitch To goof troops that wanna impress spitting over loops Better be tossing themselves through some fiery hoops Cuz my foresight is more like bottles and corks, right Provoking to be open so it can expand to more heights Its pungent to the redundant that dont rejoice to moist secretions Anointing with anecdotes and the average cant believe it Alas, Im just composing on tracks The odd wise cracks on which the trains of thought can pass As constant and rhythmic as waves breakin on a beach Writing by candle light The flame is flickering like tongues that torque the sodden speech Had the knack for the scribbling before the age of nineteen [VERSE TWO THE TOP CIVILIAN] Too many suggested perspectives, my minds completely congested My answers are just guesses, so fuck the fuckin questions Make the lessons quick, and Ill try to take them chances That will expand my gifts and put fate within my talons Ill find balance in the valley of death, however shallow How many angels and demons must perish in this here battle? I felt insignificant, but it seems now that I matter An active participant in the knowledge that I gather If I had another choice, my voice would choose the latter Ill surely need a hoist to go where angels batter Their wings. Some help to cope, or shatter my screams Rather than bring to light the addictions that my system fiends for Between a rock and hard place, life seems more Trials than tribulations while Im waitin it means more To me than it will ever mean to you or your people Actions speak so loudly they heard by Lou Ferrigno [VERSE THREE THE TOP CIVILIAN] People do unimaginable things in unbeknownst locations Unrecognizable expressions appear on unacquainted faces Case in point its all the same, but it all still changes Im just looking for a purpose, you can fuck the being famous Ill remain nameless and complacent in all of lifes stages A Mason making the most of my fate and era placement In amazement the crowd loudly applauds my efforts The sound of my voice aint no vacation, its a last resort A report of sorts about this here human condition Vital signs stereochords without near enough extension Enough retention to stay focused on tasks, focused on laughs Before dust returns to dust and ashes turn to ash A flash of light? NO! A flash of LIFE But its only fair to judge the bright against the darkness of the night And you might stop to count between the lightning and thunder The closer the storm, the lower the number I wonder when my life will flash and then BOOM! Im under the impression that at least youll find out soon And it consumes me with stress, all this madness and mess Until it concludes with my rest when nothing is left And I wept nothing more, nothing less Until it was time for me to flash! How many seconds you guess? But all I need is a mic and my motherfuckin mind All I need is a mic and my motherfuckin mind! [VERSE FOUR MC BREW] Being fluid with the movement Give your ears a good douching No conclusion, write words limitless pen in fist Other cats get put up on the eightysix list So get your fix, its nice and crisp To people who thinking when they listen to me Pushing periodicals persistently This HipHop shit just sets me free So many paint pictures of how frail rhymes are set casually And if the alleys could talk Whats with the commotion with that cuphea on the sidewalk? Chasin styles like vertical smiles with goatees Oh please! I put a sour taste to those ass kissin lips So this goes to kids that cant rhyme but still try to diss From the street to the curb from a flirt to a kiss This poet lyricist comes through with exquisiteness I dissect the dialect when I directly divulge In the duration to get the sleepyheads to get indulged Its never forgot when cocky crews act like snots Competition gets stopped as if approaching roadblocks Dudes acting glamorous putting runs in their mascara Never a beat in the world that I couldnt take care of Words imbedded like a shard of glass in a marshmallow Saying whats up to my fellows out in Colorado You notice I start to wobble when the bottles getting hollow Comin forward straight to it and itll burn you when you swallow..."

Eves that bleed Left alone with there pain Indifference breaks belief Living without feelings Blinded by unhuman being Suffocation coming slow Your visions becomes real Rotting abscess of the corpse Drives to insanity Before their eyes hope is died Deterioration grows The life will soon be gone Bodiless being in wasters becomes to spot Blackening humanity Abomination grows like pain Falling into depth of mind Brutal death leads to die Deterioration grows Incurable mutilation The life will soon be gone Prayers will help you now You will newer die before you soul be dead Damned from the birth Rest the slipped hope in the labyrinths of mind Legs, hands and face covered with rot Silent scream is heard Burning in the dark Infected with death turning into gore Fill the blackened Earth With burial sites"

"Faith misplaced now faiths disgraced. Still hoping against hope things will change. Hoping against hope, in my own sick way. Dear love, these are the strangest times. It was never enough, you were never, never mine. Glued together but meant to fall apart. It couldnt be forever, it couldnt be anything at all. From this day on, from this day forward. Now longer shall I wait, to master my own fate. From this day on, from this day forward. Behold the bridges I set ablaze. So long these hands, they were tied. Numb to the touch, a sullen prey to fates design. Glued together but meant to fall apart. It couldnt be forever, it couldnt be anything at all. Torn at the seams. Love for the loveless. Hope for the hopeless. Faith for the faithless. Speech for the speechless"

Her eyes shine, they blind me, cant help her I listen, her heart stops, and I die with her Im shivering, feverish, broken down By constant grief At nighttime I meander, blaming myself She became that hand of steel bending the carefree neck Tightening so hard Im out cold, blanck features, no movement My eyes shine, Im blinding, cant save me Dont want to, let me go, sleep away..."

"Verse 1 I was never really a scientist, but with a mind, with psychedelic rhymes in it With such beautiful optimism within, that could have made a devil even howl upon it But decisions, underestimating the cost that comes behind it Completely flip switched that man and put a, demons mind inside it Soon enough, hes violent, isolated from whos beside of him It only escalates, to the point of where hes lying his way out of a crime again The signs of him, becoming a doctor diminishing with self impoverishment Is it worth it, for and escape thatll come back and hit you twice as hard as it did But wow to feel that euphoria, bliss, with the OEVs creeping up on ya Increasing in dopamine, the perception shift, and the CEVS at the age of 15 A 15 year old not knowing when hes lit or sober When the dopes over wasnt a problem till he turned to DXM to hold him From a kid, whos mind was set to pinch his next wit To score as much as he can, with the hope of not getting indicted An atrocious metamorphosis, with the force of his curiosity So decipher this first verse, learn, and take it from me Chorus Dont get involved, one pop, one mistake comes at a cost Hold on, the bottom of the bottles coming off at your stop Just starting, it picks up and hits you up with the plot The partys gone, youre on your own, how does the end of your anecdote go? Verse 2 When I was 14 I was hyped I had my first sip of cider Sat beside my friend and told him if anyone came down, to hide it But my dad he didnt buy it, he wanted to know with his finger on it Just to figure out, that Im tired meant Im drunk or ripping chronic The problem, was constant and devoured his conscience When the games pushed up and hes booked by the school for having alcohol on him And listen to me when I say, its not easy to watch Your friend strapped up to a stretcher, life or death and youre the cause So a year later Im off again, not the same stuff that I started with Cider sipping to DXM stayed up puking nights and downing gin Im called up from my basement baked and wasted I barely made it Im shaking, legs aching I pass out looking at my parents faces music stop thing So pause! Before you hit it fore you pop it or sip The buzz it comes at a cost and cash aint part of the bet Overestimate denial, cause it fucks with your head Cause It wont happen to me, is the biggest lie you tell yourself Chorus Dont get involved, one pop one mistake comes at a cost Hold on, the bottom of the bottles coming off at your stop Just starting, it picks up and hits you up with the plot The partys gone, youre on your own, how does the end of your anecdote go? 2x talking See what the media does, they pretend to give a shit about you They pretend to give a shit about who youre going to be in 10 years You cant arrest people for drugs then advertise to buy alcohol Its absurd, its money, so dont listen to anyone Not the media, not the government, not the cops its all manipulative bullshit Because it doesnt matter what they think is right Do what you think is right, depend on nobody but yourself But just make sure that yourself makes the right decisions"
"Little children go to school but they will disappear They are taught to rule the word, dad thinks its a good idea A child is good and he cant see how easily hell be cheated Then he finds himself at the bottom living from 9 to 5 I was born in the wrong decade It was 10 years ago there were guys like me They called it New Wave but now its history People were just hanging around and in a enormous mess Hope on day it will be the same as it was then I was born in the wrong decade"
"I cannot see the sign You will not punish me The sun will never shine God damn me Sometimes I feel insane I think I have no brain My answer, I answer, will not be yours I cannot be this way but still I feel afraid I wanna kill this pain she bled me But in another way, I wanna feel the same Cant spend another day She bled me, she led me, she left me dry"
Where coldest breaths caress my ears A deadly veil of sorrow gently dances His raging destructing white AM I BEYOND THE THRESHOLD? AM I LOST? An eagle kindly shakes its wings A mesmerizing sadness in my eyes Wistful painting of dead trees The feeling of a past fading away I WALK ABOVE THE REST
"[Verse] Yow man you linked Quann today No man, Im fucked up man Rest up for a little bit For what Man them [?] they got me outta my zone man But I be fucked up man Nigga are you depressed No not really man You sound depressed Man pull your skirt down B [?] Shes fucked up You always in your zone, cant nobody take you out your zone"

"[Produced by Balistiq] [Verse 1] I know people read my tweets and think that Ive gone crazy But so do I, Ive lost my mind So good at helping others, I should help myself sometimes Dont like to be a burden on anybody else Went to the doctors, said he couldnt help Made me tick a couple boxes about how I felt Answered some awkward questions he asked Left out the drugs, dabbled in my past Said whens the last time you laughed, or went through a day without grieving? Tried not to crumble, stared at the ceiling Whos this weak bitch consumed by feelings? I used to be flying, but now Im here kneeling [Hook] Youre an impostor, I dont know your name Feel completely different, but, looking just the same Whos that bitch in the mirror?

I think theres something wrong inside my head [Verse 2] Oh my God, lets all go fucking crazy Get things started, knock back drinks and act retarded Hit some parties Maybe Ill convince myself Im not mardy Went for a shit, all you got was a fart Told a couple jokes but nobody laughed Futures bright, past is dark When youre close to the end, where the fuck do you start? Friends went missing All these actors show up when they think youve got a pot to piss in Making all these tunes but nobodys listening so whats coming next? I dont know what songs I wanna make I dont know what path I wanna take Everybodys trying to point out real to the fake I take their advice, so what, now youre my mate? Great! Were best friends! Ill never be sad again Fuck my stage name, call me Hen Keeping it real in a world pretend where girls talk less than the men Oi bruv did you hear?

Started out late In my Dirty Plaid Coat Watched my heel Lift the dead satin dress From the ground One day I touched it with my hands And it scattered like scared birds By 3a.m. they were pidgeons With drinking problems and bad luck On Gods front porch Where the wind Is dense with insects Where the wind Is dense with bugs Made of coffee and guitars
"Off the shores of another land Looming dark against the sky Stands a tower of blackest stone That outlasts time itself Eyes behold this evil and malevolent monument For it has claimed so many tortured souls Wiped out in vain The will of fate fulfilled its rage Ends a decade, a forgotten page Dark Tower Your kingdom come An heir is born We will follow and your force will grow Fear the eye of the hurricane Latent power still unseen Emerging from the sacred throne That the child king sits upon That leader rules over this malevolent monument For his reign has taken a mighty dreadful toll Forging your chains The ruins weve made in enemies land Women weve raped, tortured, enslaved Dark Tower Your kingdom come A crown of thorns We will follow, destruction will flow Decayed remains of heroes grave Martyrs insane, courageous, brave Dark Tower Your kingdom come Your blazon is worn We will follow the flag of sorrow Your kingdom come"

"It was in the long gone days of old When the mighty master of darkness Hit the earth with his terrible mace And tremendous tumults shook the soil Amidst vast vapours of fire and dust A great mound arose in the wastelands of north, And there among fields of heather and moss Began the tale of Dragons Domain... Within the majestic mountain of stone The master then carved great caves beyond count And inside the gloomy cold walls of the rock Forth brought he the darkest design of his thought And shaped a mighty kingdom for worms Finally under the roofs of the hill. Where black pitches loomed and ground belched flames. He placed the first seeds of a Dragons Domain. The new devised race of horror and dread Like birds merged with serpents of lizards, or worms Soon woke from their wyrmish slumber of time And no beasts yet greater had followed the Moon. They hardened their flesh in the fires of the earth And sharpened their claws on the edges of rock And soon every tree in the wastelands was burnt By the scorching breath of the Dragons Domain. Far beyond the borders they went And sacked and brought ruin to every neighbouring realm And the king of serpents wore a crown of their hoard A goldenhorned sign of their splendour and might And only the bravest warriors dared To enter the bare lands around the kingdom of snakes And never through many a century after Did bards forget the tale of the Dragons Domain. The bards forgot the tale of Dragons Domain..."

Through ice and fire, wind and cold Nothingll stop me! Across the sea and ancient world Where fate has brought me How come the Shadow knows my name I dont recall mistake Ive made When we finally stand alone However it ends oh no! Lets finish what I have begun The pursuit still goes on and on The Lastlands far behind my boat There is no sound there is no sea At last the Shadow comes to me Its always been my destiny Through ice and fire, wind and cold Nothingll stop me! Across the sea and ancient world Where fate has brought me How come the Shadow knows my name I dont recall mistake Ive made When we finally stand alone I swear, you wont eat my soul! The Shadow speak Darkness falls, you are mine Its your endless torment You will taste the pain Feel my grip, suffocate You will beg for a quick death I will drink your blood My fathers face, the dragons flames The Shadows changing My last one spell, Ill say my name The world is fading Together now, spoken out loud Our names are same Light and the dark, merge into one Who Ive become No one has lost, neither has won But we are one Shadow was me, part of my soul Ive let it go Ive traveled half, through out the world And now I know That it was me, I have run from Im coming...

"We had been friends for a year and a day Always around for each other When I got lost you remembered the way We were like sister and brother But last night was wine Together till dawn And something entirely different was born This is it This is love, unlike ever before I cant work, I cant eat, I cant sleep anymore Acting like a mad hatter But nothings the matter, its love We helped each other through sad love affairs Turning the tears into laughter Evryone said that our friendship was rare Not even we saw all the love that was there But last night was wine Together till dawn And something incredibly wondrous was born This is it This is love, unlike ever before I cant work, I cant eat, I cant sleep anymore Acting like a mad hatter But nothings the matter, its love Im running in circles Im walking on clouds Gonna open the window and shout it out loud This is it This is love, unlike ever before I cant work, I cant eat, I cant sleep anymore Acting like a mad hatter But nothings the matter, its love"
"Staring right at you It aint that easy to endure Now you must shut your trap To hear your words can get me hard Find a place to get no sleep Pretend to live just as you wish Beneath your scars is my way in Well, turn off my sanity Insanity were gonna live As far as you can see Wondering endlessly What makes you a cold bitch You know what we could be Drifting away on trip But youre too blind to see Cause youre a cold bitch Ill turn your pain into pleasure, oh yeah This might be your new obsession, fuck yeah I always knew you were nasty, plastic, bitch Right now youre my insanity I think Im gonna be Wondering endlessly What makes you a cold bitch You know what we could be Drifting away on trip But youre too blind to see Cause youre a cold bitch You know what we could be Drifting away on trip But youre too blind to see Cause youre a cold bitch Make it up Wake me up Wheres your god? To pray for this to never stop Make it up Wake me up Wheres your god? Now youre sitting on my cock"
I believe that Jesus existed I believe he walked the grass on which we grace A true philosopher that brought us inspiration But dont you get me wrong Its not about what I believe I could say that religion is pure evil of this world And I understand everything I could say that all innocence died on the day I was born And I would blame it on the Afghans and their Opium extracted with a knife Opium nectar of life creates The drug that keeps the world turn In this newfound world I am born again Far away from what I know As my parallel universe burst into flames I will ride once again Rise to stare you in the eyes Tell you that all is gone The fear we had before Will not return again Nothing will be the same Come stand by me my friend Nothing can shake the Earth on which we stand Side by side To face a bitter end And then we close our eyes Taking our last farewell We know we had it all We know we did our best And now we take the step Into the cosmic blast thats ending all there was
"From nothing to a spark The futures seed is planted Yet youre rotting from within A disease of desire and greed Created so pure, infected with filth The fiber of purity burns no more Strains of immeasurable failure The few who stain our failed integrity The precipice of existence Open your eyes to the force of origin Darkness bringing forth light And the light brings shadows Their minds are naive, but their souls are corrupt You had potential, you had purpose Now you have nothing but a mouth of ashes This fucking world is eating you alive"

In agony of pleasure I crumble to my knees I lick your frozen treasure You cup my furry bees But one bee bubbles over Your fleshy brimming cup It falls into the clover And lands all downside up It crawls across your stomach Not far above the food That you are still digesting Inside your large intestine And into your hydrangea It draws its furry legs Youre crouching like a stranger That aches to lay her eggs In ecstacy of pressure You quiver in the jam While naked angels measure A piece of rotting ham In symphonies of jelly You play with my disease While back across your belly There crawl dusty bees
Youre a cancer to me A coexistence Fill you with regret Unleash the disquiety Its all ripped by the plague Break your record just listen a second Hear the story of the fearless glory The rope hanging around too free Sufferless equals instant freedom I will defy Until youve come through me Spinning the bottle cant soulmate but bottom Trespass my reflection Its stated so around Its stated so loud Its stated down to the ground Path in the ground Leading to the unknown Too far from where it used to be alive Blame was it here when you came to see Closing the walls so endlessly Embracing with my sins The truth swared the most hated My life went you never came to see We broke the glass hand in hand And those are the hands The hands that now bleed
"An open eye, awakened cold on a path of Ruin that once was gold. Black mountains blocking the sun. Enveloped in decay whats devoid of life, The land is barren stone. Tonight, the shadows are screaming discourse. But you can see it in the eyes, the onyx stones. I cannot fail, and embrace the world I aimed to change. A garden looms ahead of rocky soil, With spirits swirling in a dance. There is inherent mystery in a stone unturned. Serpents feign their sleeping, covered. The sound of weeping grants relief from the sting, A method ringing. Hesitation in engaging pursuit. The eye glows red, the action ensues. Coated in mold, lungs resonate the sounds of the mire. Behold the transformation alive behind these eyes. In the moment theres a time for reflection, To bathe in the pressing instants conviction. Ive come to terms with the very real change Within the tombs, the climate anew. Coated in mold, lungs resonate the sounds of the mire. Behold the transformation alive behind these eyes. Theres ash within the rain, falling with autumn tears. The lanterns of the night burning sulfur eyes, Halting glaciers freeze. The embers dance the stars, fusing of worlds... Worlds once apart. An open eye, Awakened cold on a path of ruin that once was gold. Black mountains blocking the sun. Enveloped in decay whats devoid of life, The land is barren stone. Tonight, the shadows are screaming discourse. But you can see it in the eyes, the onyx stones. I cannot fail, and embrace the world I aimed to change. A garden looms ahead of rocky soil, With spirits swirling in a dance. There is inherent mystery in a stone unturned. Serpents feign their sleeping, covered. In the somber dusk revealed is the shadows scheme, Silencing reason."

"Cold, one night in December It took away what the angels have never faced!

It never felt this way Colors have turned to gray Since Ive been visiting your grave! I will never see your face again Never you will be Never you will see Blue eyes forever closed Our faiths twisted to eternity Now I can feel the pain is real I can see Im breaking Flowers on your grave Bring me to my knees And what is left is but a dream of a kid, And songs that echo to eternity Forever you will live in my dreams"

No,till my wisdom soar So I rob my soul down on this memory wall Mofucker till thy kingdom come REFRO Meu pai Oxal Deixa ir, deixa vir Tempo passar pa Bab, Exeupa, As"

"What is the reason, the purpose we sing for? Its Paradichlorobenzene So I just keep on singing not knowing the meaning, its Paradichlorobenzene And so I run off to find out the answer, its Paradichlorobenzene Though I know theres nothing for me to find at the end of the long lonely road So Lets go asinging, lets go a dancing, Paradichlorobenzene So lets go ascreaming, lets go ashouting, Paradichlorobenzene With the dog and the cat and the cow and the pig, too, Paradichlorobenzene Come, let our minds wander into the madness and sleep til we all rot away So Rules are the thing that I cannot stand Theyre the things that will bind me and stay my hand And so I ran, ran so far away I forgot all about all the consequences I cannot stand being told what to do All that I want is to be a bit cruel Sneak out my house and then take flight Run through the city at midnight Someone tell me what Im living for? Asking a cat, little stray that I had found This cat doesnt answer me, it just sizes Me up from the alley shadows with its glowing eyes Choking down coffee though I cannot drink it Take a look up at the sky, and Im thinking What in the world can I do at the moment? There is an answer I do not know So here I am, with this song I am screaming, Paradichlorobenzene I scream without knowing just what I am screaming, Paradichlorobenzene Tell me, is this screaming to your liking? Paradichlorobenzene If you try breaking the rules do you think that something will finally change? So All I want is to spill it to anyone, Paradichlorobenzene Beating down evil with what I call justice, its Paradichlorobenzene I use the justice to blow off some steam with some Paradichlorobenzene All the people around me are too blind to see this faade that I am putting on Is there any meaning to this song I sing? There is not a meaning to this song I sing Is there any sinning with this song I sing? There is no such sinning with this song I sing Does Benzene have a meaning, too? Benzene doesnt have a meaning, too Does Benzene have a sin as well? Meaning of this song is in the Benzene And so I realize that what Im doing Is tainted and stained by all of my hypocrisy What is the value of this life I live? Stray kittys drowned and dead and I am left alone Throwing my coffee away and I look up at Skies that are tainted and clouded with gray What am I doing with myself now? But I Dont know the answer anymore I dont know anything anymore So there you are, you are laughing at me and my Paradichlorobenzene So there I am, and I push you away from me, Paradichlorobenzene I know Im right, and I know that youre wrong, its the Paradichlorobenzene I just want to cover myself in the dark and wait until I fade away So Lets go asinging, Lets go adancing, Paradichlorobenzene Come, let us laugh until youre filled with jealousy, Paradichlorobenzene It is me, it is you, it is everything else, it is Paradichlorobenzene Come, let our minds wander into the madness and sleep til we all rot away So"

"Oh my sweet Sister Dew what have I done? All my life Ive only loved the one. I was taught to be tolerant and plain I was taught a million things I cant explain. It must have been the hatred in her eyes It must have been the power to her lies Sister tell me theres a place where I can hide Oh my sweet this is how it did unfold no my body never felt so calm and cold. All around us there were people in the park. No my senses never felt so clear and stark. And I swear that she saw it in my way and Im sure that she heard it in my voice Sister tell me please I didnt have a choice. I enjoyed to see her being idle she never had no worries, nothing vital from the day I met her to the final... afternoon. There was something there I cant describe it we were kicking ass we didnt fight it. She never once suspected, that she had it... coming soon. Oh my sweet Sister Dew what have I done? all my life Ive only loved the one. I was raised with compassion and they said I was loved for the loving that I spread Now the only thing remaining is this chill. and the only emptiness I need to fill is understanding what it is that made me KILL. Please forgive me if I keep on smiling but every sad story has a funny side in from that moment on I felt like crying... every day. All around us there were people screaming For half a second I thought I was dreaming my baby looked at me her eyes were beaming, I walked away. Oh my sweet Sister Dew what have I done? All my life Ive never loved no one. So it dawned on me this should be the place now the only thing I crave is an embrace. So let your tender wisdom be mine and let me come to you like a child Id like to stick around here for a while."
"The waves are setting rhythm The hull dancing left and right So we are heading for the night Stars are full of fire Twinkle like precious stones Reflecting on our Skull and Bones The beat of the holy sea is pounding in our hearts A compass true and clear just right from the start Sailing fire, the flame is burning in our hearts Sailing fire, a guarding light just right off the dark Icy air is drifting Blowing just on our sails Frozen hands claw at the rail The hiding dark ist resting Just underneath the keel The peace of freedoms what we feel The beat of the holy sea is pounding in our hearts A compass true and clear just right from the start Sailing fire, the flame is burning in our hearts Sailing fire, a guarding light just right off the dark When our time has come to put our hearts to rest The bodys wrappend into the Skull Bones our crest To kiss the sea The beat of the holy sea is pounding in our hearts A compass true and clear just right from the start Sailing fire, the flame is burning in our hearts Sailing fire, a guarding light just right off the dark"
"Like a song from purgatory Endless frightening vibe Sing a melody for the twisted ones Growling silently this useless burden Ready to burn Feel adrift like a wingless eagle The hum...the watch...its true... a secret to disclose Mind control, straight ahead into the precipice of haze Drive to the unknown, a safe path through the darkest of your psyche Disciple of the void Like a ghost in the cemetery Roams across the scum Hidden facts evidentiary Pulling firmly the strings of madness Behind the scene The devils in the details The hum...the watch...its true...a secret to disclose Mind control, straight ahead into the precipice of haze Drive to the unknown, a safe path through the darkest of your psyche Disciple of the void No answers, trapped souls screaming into nothingness Falling endlessly into a dreary hole Damnation. Wrapped by the black arms of the unknown The sense of freedom is suffocating Like a ravenous parasite Living off the host Dementia is taking over You cant hide, cant run from this gust neverending maze Surrender to insanity The hum...the watch...its true...a secret to disclosure Mind control, straight ahead into the precipice of haze Drive to the unknown, a safe path through the darkest of your psyche Disciple of the void"
"There is a desert in my mouth complete with tumbleweeds, A billion grains of sand, cactus and coyotes, There is a battlefield in my head complete with cannons and cavalry, Helicopters overhead, and theyre searching for yours truly, Send me the bill for the mess weve made, You survived the renaissance with souvenirs of powdered wigs and Corsets for your cracked ribcage elegant figure, Another living dead ballroom dancer shouting from escapes like Theyve got the answer, come down and well converse, can you help Me determine the measure of my worth, you know that our nightlife, It runs into daylight, Were the type of cats that bring an axe to a knife fight, Its such a scene you second guess your vision, I swear were not dumb we just make bad decisions, So go ahead and get me wrong, Id rather not be gotten right."

"Scream lost in dry, salty lake Crystals of sult glitter The sand is moist and hot Like human sight calling for help Before their boats got on the dry place Dying vicinity and country Where humans life lost the sense long time ago Last scream If there were any trees Maybe itd knock off and return to an oldman mouth Whos leaving Perhaps dying just like the lake Imprints of dead fish in salt you walk on Surely it burnts with the blood of cracked soles The scream left lost long time ago With the last drop Salty like a tear"
"I am walking in the silent rain, where the young ones free, the old mans sane, I am waliking it alone, this magic lane. The sap of those who shall remain, regain the throne of redulence, unify the leprechauns and go. Renew the sapid sward Welcome. They return. The turbid mere will quail. Zoetrope. Turning around in circles as we live. The gyration has made it turn. The tot that touches the tottery turf Hes wishing it would be a birch so that he could taste the cosy bark. I am dreaming of a branch of lime. Knowning it would heal his maul, trying hard to misgive his chief. The minx a jinx with whisk?? And it is waiting to reform. The torsive hedgehog wont!! Zoetrope...

Maybe shes looking at me... Old man is strapped to the seat of his chair, wearing a gown. Shouting and cursing at someone who clearly isnt around. Father Time has twisted his mind. The staff says, Hes not well! To whom does he speak? Maybe hes speaking to me... So we keep these people inside these walls, from society. Their forgotten lives safe from the crowd, they cant leave. Youve left them there with me. So we keep these people behind these walls, from society. Their forgotten lives safe from the crowd, they cant leave.

Timothy B. Schmit Get on down off your ladder Come out from the rain Cant you see that theres no one to blame And I got that feelin That were playin the same old game You better get on the run Cause you know its no fun Restrain yourself Can you tell me Is it for certain or does it depend Upon a feelin that refuses to bend Victim of circumstance youll say to the end And you pay no mind You just watch it pass by Restrain yourself Restrain yourself till you cant restrain no more Can you tell me why is it you sigh Is it because of a need you deny So come on up and deliver What you really know Maybe discover what it feels like To grow But youre just a mirror Reflecting a show Quiet on the scene now Come out and take a bow Dont restrain yourself
The king in a foreign land had built his childrens nest throughout the years and wars we shared the scars and swords Slaughtered was our home though blood bonds still were strong wed become the light beyond the veil of stars I stared at her gaze and saw my childrens face that night I swore in joy my thoughts would be for her A fortnight in your bed was heaven brought to earth the wounds that paint our skin had quelled our hopes within Look beyond your eyes what else is to be done? Will you save the world? Or will you save yourself? Refrain from living blind and jump into the unknown the times that pass you by are not meant to return I looked at my queen and saw my childrens dreams with no time for relief I stood and left my realm I grabbed my handmade pouch with memories once forlorn their cries made me look back like stabwounds through my spine Look beyond your eyes... I woke up old and stale and saw my childrens grave by now my eyes are dry so I must say goodbye I will not cry for you cause that would hurt us both youll always be with me after this one last breath

I dont know what to think He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring [Chorus 3] And said Marry me Juliet Youll never have to be alone I love you and thats all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress Its a love story baby just say yes [Outro] Oh, oh Oh, oh Because we were both young when I first saw you"
"If I could Id bottle up your tears And turn them to sweet water Build a wine cellar and let it age for years What a sweet drink that would be If I could capture all your charms Get some golden thread to string them on That would make such fine jewelry Then I would spend my days Selling drinks and jewelry All night and all day I know that I could make a million Selling drinks and jewelry Man Id have it my way If I could capture what your sweet eyes see And put it down in black and white For a year or two Id do it every day Get a peace prize for the book Id write Every day, might take a while Then Id paint my masterpiece And I would spend my days Selling drinks and jewelry All night and all day I know that I could make a million Selling books and paintings Man Id have it my way If only I could make a million If I could...

The shadow is above The spiritless world of Adams race The mankind has fallen Blinded by the white darkness Encountering death after death A wandering decayed soul Born again filled with fears Circle without end We have fallen in love with Death And taken it into our hearts Let it build thoughts Of its necessity and beauty Gallow that turn to tree Are filled with fruits for the wise And Death himself embraces The deathless spirit On the holy path of true salvation We walk towards understanding The love for Death must be stronger Than the one for the creators of your flesh Only pure devotion can save With the keys of living gnosis Pass the gate of continuum And Death gives birth to the other level

"Dark thoughts invade my mind The dancing is frenzy The monolith raises sinister A monotonous melody The madness is a torturing game Slow is killing me My soul cries bitter hopes While they all sing The call of Cthulhu The call of Cthulhu Crazy dreams... Remember the words of Necronomicon The wind howls again The black gate opnes silently Do I see the truth? Hideous tentacles on his face A shout without voice Immense mountains of malevolence While they all pray That is not dead Which can eternal lie Yet with strange aeons Even death may die Remember the face of my Master In my dreams under the sea Open the door and rip the veil Tell me the word, give me the power Of the black ancient knowledge IA JAG SATHOT IA SUB NE GU RATH"

"Im left standing alone The last killer in the killing field You said goodbye through gunshot fire Im still left here breathing Sold on surviving but whats the cost? You had your one shot and you took them all Woah... Hear the last train coming Roll the dice and spin the wheel Hanging by a thread but at least Im holding on Woah... Full moon rising Last dime in the wishing well Fighting for my life because its all that I have left Its a resurrection Siphon your blood straight from the ground Vaccinated with the lead of a thousand rounds Hell hath no fury? Well, it does now! Once I was lost but now Im found"
"Do you ever stop believing In the power of the human race? Do you ever start perceiving In the image in the mirror A decided fall from grace? Its a product of your disconnected state As we turn into our fathers As we strive to hold our deepest fears at bay Crashing headlong into others Blind to consequence, blind to any other way Simply doing what we must to make our way Well I say Look inside You will find A hidden world of innocence and wonder Sanctuary, boat to carry you Across the river wide All you ever had to do was look inside I can hear the skeptics screaming Take your guitar and your pseudohippy pose Platitudes aint got no bearing On the myth of my existence Or the weight of my own woes And the misery that only my heart knows. But I say Look inside You will find A hidden world of innocence and wonder Sanctuary boat to carry you Across the river wide Look inside I was lost and disenchanted Just like you at one time All I ever had to do was look inside"

I was determined just to make it, let the greats work hard L8 dont stop until the place gone drop Everytime you see my name and then they face go shocked Play that 8 track rock, yo they hate that knock Anywhere and anytime they wanna take my spot Make it quake the Gods who have forsaken us Why we aint came to trust, we are just strangers bro Chorus You dont know about me Naw What you know about me? Nothin You dont know what Ive seen You dont know where Ive been Verse 2 Now let me tell ya a simple story about AJ He could care less if a hater may complain Cause all you people are just looking for a hand out Never owed you a damn thing, let alone a fan shout Yo homie man down, why you so mad now? Thinking youre the man, Ill show you I aint playin how Most of these other rappers laugh at me Lacking the audacity to rack and track And stack a beat in rapid action accurately Been in it for a minute not finished I get it how I live it Got in it to win it and make my percentage Ive taken such an offense towards all the business you wreckin But yo I never expected to feel much disrespected and now That Ive been blessed with a throat And that Im a weapon alone Throughout the messages wrote, when Imma stress and explode Have em all echoin yo Who are the best in BLo?

For a stain is on my linen, Blood that I must wash away God! if I should fail to do it, Dread things happen to me may. Father of mercy, forsake me not! Then at this appeal the judges At each other look aghast Silent all and mute their voices By their eyes the die is cast. Father of mercy, forsake me not! Thou art free go home, poor woman Go and wash thy linen sheet Wash it clean and may God strengthen And with mercy thee entreat! Father of mercy, forsake me not! And poor Agnes in the streamlet Goes to wash her linen sheet Downward is her now clean cover Carried by the current fleet. Father of mercy, forsake me not! Snowwhite long has been her linen Trace is none of red bloodstain Yet poor Agnes ever sees it, Bloodred still she sees it plain. Father of mercy, forsake me not! From the early dawn till evening. Sitting there, she laves the sheet Waves may sway her trembling shadow, Winds her grizzled tresses greet. Father of mercy, forsake me not! When the streamlet in the moonlight Shimmers, and her mallet gleams, By the streamlets bank she washes, Slowly beating as in dreams. Father of mercy, forsake me not! Thus from years end unto years end, Winter, summer, all year through, Heat her dewsoft cheek doth wither, Frosts her feeble knees make blue. Father of mercy, forsake me not! And the grizzled hair turns snowy, Raven, ebon now no more While the fair soft face of wrinkles, Sad to see, augments its store. Father of mercy, forsake me not! Mistress Agnes in the streamlet Washeth still her ragged sheet Downward are the covers remnants Carried by the current fleet. Father of mercy, forsake me not!"

"After I said goodbye I promised myself Id try To get my mind off you and back to reality But only lightning striking me, shaking me up could ever do that trick Caught up in your love I was halfway home on a jet airplane, halfway between joy and pain Thinking about walking with you by the evergreens The way that light struck your eye, captured your face, nestled in my memory Caught up in your love Im looking out my window at blue skies above caught up in your love And Im having all these thoughts too wild to speak of caught up in your love I dont care if its foolish to feel this way I will take my chances with you despite what people say People say, Pay no mind, you dont want to waste your time Loving one when theres so much more for you to see. But they dont got what Ive got, the jackpot, fits me like a glove Caught up in your love"

Wait till youre thighdeep in more corpses [Verse 1] They say that Im the bad guy always bashing what the masses love The truth is that they blind and they cant see I done had enough Maybe I should leave before this anger has me smashing stuff But before I go its time to settle things and pack it up Has it ever crossed your mind why atheists were hard to find But now you hear them all the time and theyre feeling no need to hide Its cause some of us have decided that humans are divided By too many concepts that the charlatans will use to lie with Politics and patriotism mixed with religion Combustible mixture when added together blows quicker We have witnessed the results of dogmatic divine edicts We were forced to sit in silence you serve it and we eat it And while we were complacent your shit have become invasive Like attacking reproductive rights and your hatred of gays and Like the bully in the schoolyard He only goes as far as we let him Until we get pissed and we deck him [Sample 2] Detective Rustin Cohle What do you think the average IQ of this group is, huh? Just observation and deduction I see a propensity for obesity.

Detective Martin Hart You see that? Your fucking attitude. [Verse 2] Your racism looks really stupid from orbit And in fact were at the point as a species we cant afford it You arguing about which hominid is the most prominent Is one of the most ridiculous things that I have a problem with You seem kind of confused but dont worry Im here to help you out It turns out we all kind of suck now shut your fucking mouth A bunch of chimps that got a chip on their shoulder just need to grow up Or I doubt we get a millennium older What will rise up from the smolder to replace us placeholders Hopefully will be much smarter than us, maybe the roaches Get this straight the color of the your face is no reason to hate Your xenophobic tendencies typically overstate All our meaningless differences Now picture this if we all self identified as human What would the demagogues do then? Who even really knows Theyd probably find some other reason to keep us bleeding Thats just the way that shit goes [Sample 3] Detective Martin Hart I mean, can you imagine If people didnt believe What things theyd get up to? Itd be a fucking freak show of murder and debauchery and you know it Detective Rustin Cohle If the only thing keeping a person decent is the expectation of divine reward Then brother that person is a piece of shit And Id like to get as many of them out in the open, as possible"

On the top of the Falconhill... I was standing surrounded by solitude Evening breeze as my only friend It was a beautiful dusk of November Darkness wrapping around the hills where paths end To my eyes reflected a distant fire A fire from far away A sign our enemy is approaching From the land beyond the bay Beyond the mist covered forest on the river I saw Three dozen ships with crosses on sails Soon everywhere burnt fires Mine among the others From the village a horde was marching Till death or fame! To my eyes reflected a distant fire A fire from far away A sign our enemy is approaching From the land beyond the bay By the time the sun was about to rise above the skyline The army of the cross and heathen hordes collided By the time the sun was lurking high behind a cloud Only the heathen swords were held against the sky They were slaughtered and vanished for now But they will return to spread their word and kill It was a godagainstgodbattle I saw On the top of the Falconhill

How is no one talking about this? Thanks, thanks for your service, Now die, die in silence.

"Passing aeons Everlasting fight against the Evil Their army grows on and on With the darkening horizon Im not afraid, let them come I will never retreat I will stand and hold my ground Protect the ancient tree The defense is doomed to fall With the world I used to know Burning leaves Turn to ash before my eyes, Crushed my dreams long gone. Burning leaves Dead branches reach to the sky, The flame within me is gone. On the light of the last dying star Serpents crawl closer All five branches, cursed from the start And roots are torn to pieces Right before my dying breath I lay my eyes to the sky As an eagle spreads its wings for the last time Leaving me, the oak, the grove, to die Burning leaves Turn to ash before my eyes, Crushed my dreams long gone. Burning leaves Dead branches reach to the sky, The flame within me is gone. Liek en pll maan Ainuttakaan joka muistaa Lehdon tuon kauniin kaukaisen Jonne tie vie jokainen Kun kuolemaan vartija viimeinen Keskell liekkien ikuinen Puu ja maailma ihmisten Niin loppuu aikamme I wonder if any longer someone walks the Earth who recalls That fair Grove afar, where all paths meet As the last of the guardians falls, ablaze the Eternal Tree and Domain of Man Thus ends Our Time"

"The moaning of the heathen trees Through the pathways of the forest deep As shes walking by the flowing stream Like the spirits there she wants to creep Listening to the wind thats calling Coming from the caves Rising from the earth Offering her soul Her soul is floating Slowing as the river, As the dying breath Sail away beyond the weeping clouds Filling with rain your journey home The end lying ahead, Far from the sounds Close your eyes and bleed no more Her life in wisdoms crystal Like the wine which made me drunk Leave now, meet your fate Chase the stars, the wildest hunt Sinful ghost in beauty adored Wiping from the memories and lore Welcome home to those who crawl The faithful to the crying shore Sail away beyond the weeping clouds Filling with rain your journey home The end lying ahead, Far from the sounds Close your eyes and bleed no more Offering her soul Her soul is floating Slowly as the river As the dying breath Sail away beyond the weeping clouds Filling with rain your journey home The end lying ahead, Far from the sounds Close your eyes and bleed no more"

"Amidst the endless darkness and gloom, my eyes lock with her smile across the room. The light it creates, is blinding to me. Reflection of her fangs, is all I can see. In her bite, I cant feel an ounce of pain. Im paralyzed, like the heroin hold on a numb vein. Her leather wings, they seem to cover me. They form a shield, and prevent me to bleed! When she speaks I hear a ghoulish symphony! It brings new life to this body of atrophy! Once I was poisoned. She nearly watched me die. Through her bloody kisses, I am revived! In her eyes, I can see this moment, frozen in time. As well as the world we burned and left behind. When she speaks I hear a ghoulish symphony! It brings new life to this body of atrophy! She takes me away, to a better place. The glow in her eyes shows me the way. We rise from the black, to a brand new day. She takes my hand. We walk away from the world as it burns. Hand in hand we leave it behind. She smiles at me and I look in her eyes. Im lost in this moment. Frozen in time."
"Your ship is sinking, the lights are blinking And I am watching as you drown Your ship is sinking, and youre obsessing The lights are blinking You are going down Keep asking why the boards have broke As every scream will only choke So many words, it doesnt move As youre struggling to breathe, you realize.... The ship is sinking, ship is sinking Ship is sinking, the ship is sinking You had a warning You kept ignoring And now youre drowning You are drowning Lightning and tears The boards have broke And every scream has only choked Now as your lungs take in the cold The fading of your life is the only thing you cannot control The ship is sinking, ship is sinking Ship is sinking, the ship is sinking Ship is sinking Your ship is sinking, your ship is sinking...."
"Neglest me, lose me only give me leave unworthy as I am to follow your grief Therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose The human mortals want their winter cheer Love takes the meaning in loves conference So that but one heart we can make of it The stary welking covers you anon with dropping fog as black as acheron Thorny anger, be not seen come not near out fairyqueen For nights swift dragons cut the clouds I tary for the comfort of the day Fair love, I see, I forgot our way Stand steel, you ever moving spheres in misery noone will hear And they shoot chillness to my heart I cant break the midnight sigh"

Move forward to a real progression Mouths move quicker than a mind and perception Self righteousness becomes a killer of the soul You think you got it all jaded fool youre bound to fall Set me free let me be as I face this war inside Move forward to a real progression Dont let the past pull you down and suppress you You think you got it all jaded fool youre bound to fall Set me free let me be as I face this war inside Set me free so I can be the man I know Im supposed to be now Underneath scars and lies youll find Buried in a man that hides inside The truth will burn before your eyes in time Gotta learn to rise up
Verse 1 Typ iLL Im counter effective with my weapon on safety I switch the selection to fire Renegade for higher I blaze thee Keep the remote close Flip the channel when I wanna flip it From a young buck fast forward to a grown folk Ducking Narcs up in my younger days Ds pulling up in hummer trucks 24 inch gold spokes Back of the CVS alleyway My Memory flash flash bang in my enemys path as they retaliate My peoples will lock and load pop it till I unload Switch up this magazine not a comic book episode But Im flipping pages as quick as Im pumping gauges I blow Militant in my body Im diligent when I roll Daz Dillinger Johnny Depp a promise not a threat My feelings is 4 wheeling Im peeling on any set Playa! Where my friends at they not around When I needed that voice of reason shh not a sound So when my people tell me Typ you gotta make it I reply with this record for all my fans who be putting me in their playlist Came with a crew full of young hyped teens A few outcasts and pill heads with young pipe dreams I find it hard to knock it But opposition got no option But the ? is what Im bringing to the table for a profit I wont stop this until Im dead I do this rap shit for war vets and hip hop heads Verse 2 Termanology Theres a war going on outside no man is safe from In your mental its not coincidental I done looked death in the eyes plenty of times When you find yourself stumbling on enemy lines See the flames and the fire reflecting off of your retina Its obvious you sold your soul I raise my weapon up Cause Im trying to take what ever soul you have left Your man try to roll up then he fin to get shot next A leader but Im humble these streets is like a puzzle So you gotta keep your eyes peeled creeping through the jungle My cousin went to jail for packing heat and moving bundles Its easy to judge when you aint see that man struggle Im focused on my goal thats living as long as I can live Sometimes I feel hopeless choke up and think about my kids I swear a must have been a warrior in my past life Same scars on my back swear I been stabbed twice Nightmares every night fighting that good fight Stabbed him a 100 times that was under the moonlight His soul is possessed put a hole in his chest In fact you can leave that mess for the EMS Its all about residuals and what you can leave If you die a broke man you aint do shit for your seed Thank society go head judge me on my sobriety But if you gone tell it tell the story entirely DJ Scratching No Surrender No Retreat Rolling with heat

"Sometimes our body lives Apart from our consciousness Faces can be the cause of the rebellion The strange movements of the bowels Announce a visceral revolt A slight tear and a hidden throb The putrefaction yeasts ceaselessly Sickness eats everything away Like a huge, monstrous worm stench invades The land of the deadly burst riddles The overflows a flood of bowels The colon spreaces out, The bones of the anus crack terribly The creature drown in an ocean of excreta"

Manchesters best Im from a place where nobodies implace, and dont wanna see no body progress So they wanna take shots at my ego, but I got a built stab proof vest Ive been stabbed in the back so much, Im like Jesus in the Passion of Christ I was sat counting about 25 grand, I got delusional, the Queen started talking I was like whys everbody warring, she said Politics are boring Cause its all propaganda, and comes down to the fact that moneys more important Than poverty, feeding the poor, the rich get rich, we get ignored Middle class people, that have done everything what Government told them Struggle to pay the bills cause when they go to the bank, it says their accounts been frozen So damn right Im taking doors of hinges, Im running in through the hall way Holding a big boy sword like a Viking, but Ive never been from Norway Anybody comes at me, I stick it in cause I dont do foreplay I make a man bleed sick, so it looks like tomato puree Youre looking at Bugzy Malone, every video is a new part of my story And I was born back in 1990, so were looking at episode 40 I say look when Im spitting, cause I spit bars in high definition Its like watching a wide screen television, and this one heres like doubleohseven Why, cause Im on a one man mission to put my town on the map, Im reppin But Im worse than a nuclear weapon, cause I make your whole town go missing I know when Ive said something sick, when I see a mans head start tilting Im like Wolverine from the XMen, cause the metal is built in Ive not set fire to the booth, Ive set fire to the whole building Charlie was gonna jump out the window cause the smoke in the room couldve killed him Drove past my mums old house on bury new road, the one I got evicted from Drove straight past, onto the motorway and into the distance don Looked in my rear view, thinking about the past on a majestic one Cause if I didnt go through what I went through, then I probably wouldnt have wrote this song [SECOND Bugzy Malone] Look, theres a lot to be said, lot to be told, lot to be confessed Im holding dough so Im overly stressed I wear my hat low cause Im now to the feds Trying to be cool but Im losing my head Plus I heard couple man wanted me dead Tell them man weve got the machine, and I see them when they get out of pen Fuck music, I seem them when they hit road Ill be on your TV and your stereo Ill be on your blackberry and your iPhone Everybody knows about Bugzy Malone But I gotta confess, in Oh10 I fell off Made 10 quid, made bare man jelous Spent every penny in about 6 weeks But I dont care now that Im back well off Fuck bitches, I just do big bits Im just tryna get rid of boxes like Kelloggs So I can get the Kawasaki Ninja matte black Im a rider, and they forgot Me, a machine, a ninja, red hot Tell my man Ill take his head off Ill die for my family and thats for my mums life Did they forget these my brudda Did they forget that I come from the gutter and I spent Oh7 in the slammer Never seen the summer, they let me out, and I ate man like I never had a dinner Prayed to the Lord like Id never been a sinner Take off the front door like Im onto a winner Gambled my freedom, everday I wake up and youd of thought I was a roulette spinner I go in, they just go in Im Bugzy Malone, the wickedist thing since Lucifer dropped with a broken wing They spill the beans like an open tin But Im ODT so Im on this thing Tell them Gunchester run this thing I run up, put the ting in their mouth I make their legs shake, bondage ting Im the general, front line solder, run this grime ting 10 times over Go tell Chipmunk not to be cheeky Grime is a road ting, my mans hopeless Go make a pop tune, fuck your As and Bs You went from chipdiddychip to the streets Oopsie Daisy Im not in your league Well Ive been on the roads playing hide and seek Hide from the feds, seek my enemies Its like Ive got some free [?] Cause when I say turn into the devil, its like bare bitches drop to their knees Ive been dissecting boxes of cheese since I was 18 I had 5 workers, thats 5 phones, 5 days in we made 5 Gs, thats 2 grand profit Have you gone mad, I made 10 grand in about 5 weeks Thats no secret, man know me Bugzy Malone is not just an MC I got locked up, aged 16 So fuck Chipmunk and his As and Bs I rep this grime thing properly, 0161 Watch how they walk with me Trust me, watch how they walk with me Fuck that dough cause I spent that fast No money management, fucking with cash These days man just say fuck the pass Nowadays my whips better than your dads My old headmaster used to have a jag Now that Im buying and selling whips I got one of them parked up on the path Tell the headmaster my S lines faster And Im still going on wicked and bad Expell me, are you having a laugh Everyone knows the recession is bad You might as well go remortgage your gaff Or downgrade, now that Im paid, Ill put the mortgage dipper on that, Ill pay the mortgage dipper Fuck the headmaster and everyone I beat up Cause its your fault that Im on this path"
"[Verse RZA] Knowledge, that means to know Where you come from and where you want to go Its also the basic foundation For the creation of a strong nation Know the ledge, dont fall off the edge And stop walking around like the living dead In these days and times youve got to purify Your body and your mind Stop taking drugs and eating swine Thats not the right track for the young seeds We need to take heed Understand how to be a real man Pick up the Bible, and Quran Maybe a mixture of all the scriptures Can help us to get a clear picture Whats going on nowaday in the world Why do grown men molest little girls Is it because the girl breast have swelled To the size of a woman although shes 12 Or are the men sick, sick, sick, sick Trapped up in 666 You better grab your crucifix and salute Beware the forbidden fruit We march to the drums and we stroll to the flute And strive to regain our true attribute Excel to degrees that brains cant compute Behold! In the atom we unfold the black hole! And found the black soul But the gene was separated from that was created Plus evaporated but now was integrated The white and the black The gods they brought em back To that which is pure and right and exact You cant reform them, wisdom, reborn them Till the knowledge and the truth rewards them He who dwells in the pits of hell Be cast in the fire, the eternal cell But the righteousness get the light of us Have eternal bliss although he might be dust The zigzag zilla came wisdom will heal the main I will teach you the seven plains so you can remain In Gods dimension when the brain refrains From negative, and deal with the positive We are chosen, and thats how we got to live Forgive us for our sins We strive to be Achozen Forgive us for our sins We strive to be Achozen"
"Drawing attention to yourself at anothers expense. Your puritan stance carries a certain pretence. When an ego is at stake, theres always a point to make. Bigotted and self opinionated there is no give and take. Obsessed with changing the world, not in changing yourself!"
"Satan represents all of the socalled sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!"
I am the sun That from the plinth of shadow Looks at something that was yesterday tomorrow If you went the paths of my thoughts You could say a few words That are missing In the late summer ... a lazy late summer I am the Star That knows somewhere there is someone Shining like my sorrow Hes looking at yesterday tomorrow He know the paths of my thoughts He would say a few words That are missing In the last summer Thinking about the inessential Daydreaming about the reality Makes me build while destroying Without the skins shield Naked flesh is bleeding Like the touch of knife in a drawer Not expecting the awakening ... a lazy late summer
"Breathing murder upon the early church Destruction, the new faith to hurt Fueled by zeal, a twisted perception Creating disorder, a morbid obsession Profession of faith to persecute From heaven a voice, journey refute Falling to the ground To arise without sight Holy Spirit fill, falling scales from smite Conspiracy to kill, voice of conversion Speaking freely, a bold proclamation"

"[Verse 1 Bobby Raps] Laughing in the face of death Higher than a space cadet Aspire to greater steps Kill the game, I arrive just to pay respect All that talking you do is cheap, you aint making sense Breaking bread, boy, you couldnt break a thread Making threats, boy, you couldnt make a friend Take offense, over something someone says you said You get slept, make your bed, no escape, save your breath K, whats next? These boys hardly harder Im like a modern Charlie Parker mixed with Ali Baba Leave these kids more fucked up than that Molly got em Like a Lil Scrappy song, you dont want no problems Sigh idly, then reply calmly Lie to me, then rely on me The day is gone, this is afterlight But Im like an old school singer, Im glad its night Corbin asked me if Im scared of dying The more I think about it, Im kind of excited Maybe thats because my mind is sick and demented But death aint shit but a new adventure Death aint shit but a new adventure [Verse 2 Corbin] You dont see, but Ive been holding back Tempted to do off, end it all at that You can help me if your aim is pure But theres no medicine, you know the cure And I could be alone, but I faint, its my fate Ooh, and I could be alone, why wait on?

"You lived your life like a golden hour When the sun has set and has lost its power You lived your life in a golden hour And no one lived it with you And no one lived it with you No one lived it with you No one lived it with you You lost your life in the desert hush With the moon so bright in the twilight blush You lost your life in the desert hush And no one shared it with you No one shared it with you No one shared it with you No one shared it with you So thanks for the wonderful For the beautiful incredible light You were so wonderful So beautiful, incredible life You left us all on the desert shore As if we didnt know you As if we didnt know you As if we didnt know you As if we didnt know you You lived your life like an accident You were a fool who said what you meant You took your life like an accident Who could share it with you Who could share it with you Who could share it with you Who could share it with you"
"I came in sixtythree With a song in my head I grew up impatiently Thinking too far ahead With no choice I started to voice Everything I believed I knew you that I was the one Who would never retreat No till I get what I need No till I get what I need Till I get what I need On the run and chasing the sun Never looking behind It aint over till its done And Im able to find The one thing that drives me To reach far beyond the stars I wont break, Im not gonna breach Until I make my mark No till I get what I need No till I get what I need Oh till I get what I need Till I get what I need No can I get what I need No can I get what I need Oh can I get what I need Can I get what I need No will I get what I need No will I get what I need Oh will I get what I need Will I get what I need"

"I need a makeshift lover like a bullet in the head. Thanks to them Ive grown despondent. Something about the way, something about the way you say that love cant save, sounds like the whisper of a snake. Wait for the right time to strike, then spit your venom. Ive become a man devoid of trust in anyone who wasnt bound by blood, for water only proves thicker in our tears. I have never known a dream to transcend reality without a reason to retreat. Theres something about the way you say I will never see the day when love becomes my only saving grace... Beneath the moonlight, you seem so lovely. Oh how our eyes deceive, now dont they? I have never known a dream to transcend reality without a reason to retreat. Something about the way you say, nothing can overcome this pain sounds like the devils poison reckoning. Spit venom. Every wounded lover has the feeling theyll never heal. Every ruined romance leaves the stain of regret. On to the next foolish victim waiting in line to sign away their life. On to the next foolish victim... Take the lead, a foot on the floor one in the grave. Cant you just see were destine to deserve this? Follow me, a foot on the floor one in the grave. Cant you see were dancing with the devil?"
"The malice of being alive Your dark hidden desire, winner The lust for another life It s the rebirth of your soul A release in an other world Heres a body for death A soul to become a part of space Watch the mortals from higher See the filthy world and laugh Fake life... you want to kill and die You want to touch the face Of the other side You want to be an eternal king Only feeling your serenity You want to begin the eternal journey Through the silent path of death Exstasy of madness World has been a place so mournful, Man became a thing, Laughter has been a secret weapon, Life is just a dream Death will reap its way But only for the insects May suicide become The expanding blessed disease..."
"Dont worry anymore, our relationship is over Dont cling on to me, please leave me you need to change yourself Everybody, see a new light oh bring me your love, bring me your love Anybody, lets all start over Oh raise your hand up, start shaking lets move Show it to me slowly sexy, Oh follow the rhythm up Come closer, lets move, dont let me lose you sexy Do you still remember my expression when I let you go? I hope you dont stop giving your best Everybody start to feel oh bring me your love, bring me your love Right here, right here Oh right on top, Up, keep dancing, lets move One step closer sexy you cant stop, Oh raise it higher up Towrads me, lets move, tonight sexy is all meant for you all night long Do you still remember my expression when I let you go? I hope you dont stop giving your best Oh raise your hand up, start shaking lets move Show it to me slowly sexy, Oh follow the rhythm up Come closer, lets move, dont let me lose you sexy"

I watch it all collapse It never seems to last As long as I need it to A beautiful mistake A wound without a trace Was it ever really true? We cant see the future We cant rewrite the past Tried to hold it captive But it faded all too fast Is it much too late To save yourself? Memories keep calling Deeper into fear Im falling Lost within my mind it haunts me for so long Trapped beneath the glass Never a shadow cast A perfect pictures all I knew Lost within the struggle Never felt so much alive Gave into the rapture Didnt care if I survived Is it too much late To save yourself? Memories keep calling Deeper into fear Im falling Lost within my mind It haunts me for so long All my hope is dying Even though I keep on trying Lost within my mind It haunts me for so long
"[Verse 1 Casso Clay] I took a walk, took a turn, went around the bend Saw my life burn with the summers end And unconscious rendered, I just watched the ember Then I took all this venom, filled up my pen Ive got a lot to give but nothing to lend Watch on my wrist, Im still late again With enemies like this, who needs a friend? Man, I throw them away with the sticks and stems I write a letter, then I stamp and I stick and send I was banged up, now Im on the mend Im back in it, back on it, addicted crack chronic My tonic, never long it on the bonnet cause it just hit In the morning looking rustic, take a sip Take a hit, plus this itll lick Met this chick, she was fit, I was pissed, hitormiss Imma try it, whats the odds, chances? Multiply it Imma start a riot, steam, roast, fry it Dry it, smoke it, losing my focus Hocus pocus, Im a wizard with the potion Roll in slowmotion, I know that theyre hoping For Casso to return again Writing so much that I burnt the pen, but when, where Were you when the sun went down?

"Look him in the face as I speak blasphemous gospel. Turning Christians to insane and humiliation. God is not the way, Worship the devil with power. Enemy of me you will always be theres no coming back. Crucified and murdered on the cross the enemy of mankind Fuck you Christ. Never will you return from the rotting grave. God crying watching his creation dying in pain. The golden palace feels all the fury of the Black Knights of hell. Anno Domini Nostri Satanas Following the path of Lucifers name without brainwashed to believe. Goatmaster taking Christians to sacrificial altar and cut your throat. Desecrate holy ghost in pure blasphemy destroying their churches and crushing their heads. This is the acclamation against celestial motherfuckers and liars Anno Domini Nostri Satanas We calls the true worshippers without fear without god. Hear the voice of might Satan and take immortality, Now we have our victory against Abrahamic hypnotic theocracy. This is the vengeance of forgotten souls in hell."

"Entity of night, creature of damnation Disciple of the fire, the guardian of lord Satans empire Too black to be seen, spawned by the furious winds Alive but dead, with hate my eyes glow red In my coffin, only unholy ashes remains Once shining and bright, now thriving in hellish domains Storms, earthquakes, raging seas Visions of the end and what will be Unleashed from the netherworld Armed with shadows, my legions sets free Knight of the netherworld Lord of storms to be Wraith of the underworld Pandemonium opens for me The entity of night, bringer of damnation Scorching black pyre, the tormenting fire"
"Oh, they are coming In silence they seem passing The portal to our ancestors No look behind in sorrow In honour they are leaving Knowing, I will follow So silent are their movements With pale faces of void But wellknown touch of closeness Paralyzed by the appearance I stand Even the smell of death is real No scream wakes me up from this nightmare No more quest of time, hour zero The court is open, certain the sentence Tonight my destiny will rise from the shadows Of my doubts Dead faces point my way I will follow as they say Passing the Portal Follow the child with the cross Follow the priest and the funeral march Look in the eyes of your past Tasting the smell of decay"

"In the coldest embrace of dusk I drown the rays of daylight The suns, gathered in void, implode and reappear as novas Thence the mask of night cant cover the embers of ardor And my will of control and dominion lasts through joy and pain Im above the oceans of time Father of timeless nights Amongst the blackening skies I am the light In the silent whisper of night I seal the eyes of desire The Never filleth the hearts of dreamers enchained in pleasure So the lack of feelings will weaken the planets attraction And the apathy will dip the shapes into the formless Im above the oceans of time Father of timeless nights Amongst the blackening skies I am the light May my solemn word be law So I can see the emptiness and refill it with fullness May my brightest light be unleashed at the end of time So I can shine like a million suns, and be the One above all In the sweetest kiss of dawn I devour the shadows of madness The stars fade behind the veil of the purest Aurora Thus the rays of Sun cant bare the blasphemous secrets That howl, fearless, against the loudest of the thunders Im above the oceans of time Father of timeless nights Amongst the blackening skies I am the light Above the oceans, beyond the shadows I am the light amongst the blackening skies!"

"Why do I feel this way? Deep in my mind I know that I should stay away Anyway I go, down below Down to the cellar where the little girl just might show The Dark is so much darker here The candlelight cant break the sensation of fear I see a trail of blood Leading down into the Dark where no one should go I shouldnt be down here, not tonight Evil is in the air, tonight I shouldnt be down here, not tonight Everything is closing in on me Here I am, in the Dark, theres no return Then in a halo of light... I see a shape... I know its her... Ohh So many black little wings meet me as I enter the cellar So many black little wings, black little wings on my face Oh no no no, I cannot see, I cannot see whats going on I hear her breathe, I hear her wheeze And then she points her little finger right at me Mine mine mine mine, give me your soul please Mine mine mine mine STAY AWAY FROM ME Mine mine mine mine, give me your soul please Mine mine mine mine Oh no no no I... Ive got the get away Her piercing eyes will burn deep into my mind I slowly turn around I can feel her closing in, and then Im falling down The Dark is so much darker than before The candle in my hand doesnt burn anymore I think Im losing my mind As Im barely crawling out, out of this place I shouldnt b down there, not tonight I cant believe I made it out of there"

"After the journey is over And the trails have all come to an end At the end of years, therell be no more fears Only a ship sailing off into the clear After this life is over In a hall at the end of the earth They will serve to you the finest brew A mead twice as cool as morning dew Long have I sought in search of respite, For the hall at the end of the earth I first heard the tale on the darkest of nights When my fears denied my worth. In a crashing thunderstorm, I thrashed upon the rocks. I sank into the water, then I thought that I was lost, Alone on the sea My heart was in doubt I saw the kings of warriors I heard them singing out! I sailed for a year and a day with those men The price I had paid for my life. Id all but forgotten the song I had heard In the blackest of my darkest nights. Then there came a day, The wandrer came my way He wore a cloak and an ashen beard And these words I heard him say Kindly show the way, To an old man in decay, Your life is all but over now, You and I must not delay! Do you know the way to the hidden valley? Long is the way that we must go! Over the waves and the watrey alleys, There they brew the finest mead I know! And on the third day we set out from port, The old man disappeared That night, the sun went down beyond the edge of the sea Never to rise up again. For nine long weary nights We tumbled without day Until one morn we saw the light Of the glittering Bifrost way Standing on the rocks As we could plainly see Was Heimdall, lord of the skymountain Staring down at me! The figure rose out of the mist With eyes that burned like fire He raised his blade to the sky And this is what he said You must go over the great rainbow bridge, my new friends, into the city of Asgard! There you will find the golden hall you seek, and Odin, king of the Aesir! We had come to our final destination! To the great walled city of the Gods! We raised our blades up to Odin, the king! To Asgard, and the great Valhalla! But at the end of the day, The wanderer came our way And said, Don these holy instruments And let these bastards here you play! For there will come a day When everything will die The Fenris Wolf and the World Serpent Will hear this joyous cry! Do you know the way to the hidden valley? Long is the way that we must go! Over the waves and the watrey alleys, There they brew the finest mead I know!"

"Little somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne [Verse 1] Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots I give a holla to my sisters on welfare 2Pac cares, if dont nobody else care And, I know they like to beat you down a lot When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot But please dont cry, dry your eyes, never let up Forgive but dont forget, girl, keep your head up And when he tells you you aint nothin, dont believe him And if he cant learn to love you, you should leave him Cause sister, you dont need him And I aint tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em You know what makes me unhappy When brothers make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy And since we all came from a woman Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman I wonder why we take from our women Why we rape our women, do we hate our women ? I think its time to kill for our women Time to heal our women, be real to our women And if we dont well have a race of babies That will hate the ladies that make the babies And since a man cant make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up I know youre fed up ladies, but keep your head up [Refrain x2] Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child, thingsll get brighter [Verse 2] Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me He had me feelin like black was the thing to be And suddenly the ghetto didnt seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two And I realize Momma really paid the price She nearly gave her life to raise me right And all I had to give her was my pipe dream Of how Id rock the mic and make it to the bright screen Im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents Its hard to be legit and still pay the rent And in the end it seems Im headin for the pen I try to find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems the rainll never let up I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up You know its funny when it rains it pours They got money for wars but cant feed the poor Say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is It aint no hope for the future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby We aint meant to survive cause its a setup And even though youre fed up Huh, ya got to keep your head up [Refrain x2] [Verse 3] And uh, to all the ladies havin babies on they own I know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone Daddys long gone and he left you by your lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em Cause I think we can make it, in fact, Im sure And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more Cause aint nothin worse than when your son Wants to know why his daddy dont love him no mo You cant complain you was dealt this Hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless Because theres too many things for you to deal with Dyin inside, but outside youre looking fearless While tears is rollin down your cheeks Ya steady hopin things dont fall down this week Cause if it did, you couldnt take it, and dont blame me I was given this world I didnt make it And now my sons gettin older and older and cold From havin the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is drivin Benz Im still tryin to hold on to surviving friends And its crazy, it seems itll never let up, but Please, you got to keep your head up"
"Talking bout you and me Is nothing short of a jubilee Everything you gave to me is mine Things I didnt quite demand Now I finally understand This Ill say until the day I die Leaving flowers at my doorstep Dropping notes in the mail Persistence must be pumping in your veins Telling friends that you love me Showing up at everything Funny how I do not feel the same Oh but its too late baby You used to leave me hanging Kept me waiting by the phone And how I love to see you aching Breaking, beat up, shaken, sorry blubbering heart Used to be you and me Sitting underneath the tree Everything was fine as I could see Teasing me with your rhymes Watching other girls go by Think Im blind? oh honey, no not me! I would sit by the window Waiting for you to call Fireflies were dancing in the trees Sweety pies from another places Giving them all your love How did you ever find the time for me?"

He cant get out of bed this morning You can tell that hes been crying From the stains on his pillow case last night He wonders why he got no warning He wonders all the time Well maybe in his dreams hell make it right He finally pulls himself together And tries to face his life But the thought of her cripples him inside He wonders if she thinks about him Or if she feels alright These thoughts dont seem to leave his mind At least hes still got so much Time on his hands Time to get back on his feet again Time left to stand Time to let go of his feelings Problems in his life get clearer As he finds some peace of mind It gets a little easier with time No he doesnt have all the answers But he figures thats alright Cause some things in life you just cant find At least hes still got so much Time on his hands Time to get back on his feet again Time left to stand Time to let go of his feelings All he wanted to find Was a heart to match his own When she left him behind She killed the girl he thought hed known Time on his hands Time to get back on his feet again Time left to stand Time wont let go Time to let go of his feelings Wont let go Time on his hands Time wont let go Time to get back on his feet again
"A bright moon shimmering brilliance Inspiring lunacy Casting a shadowy eclipse Staring at the beauty that burns out these lusting eyes Id rather still be blindly curious Than in this state of disillusion Inducted with a feast Then perpetually starved and teased Warm smiles returned with dull daggers Impaled by the silence of a failed situation I am alive but barely breathing Awaiting this life to begin Repeatedly killing me before this life can be endeavored Nine lives abort me but I cant inveigle one This silence kills me sweetly and softly The valuable ones are always the underdogs Award the prize to the shallow ones the mundane, the heartless A swim in pressurized chemicals unreleased from indicted isolation Sensory pleasure replaced by neurological distraught Virulence of cryptographic perfection immiscible disconnection Save self by creating an inhibition of transference Sandbox murderer Create a supervillain From the underdog A broken shell of a superhero"

The colossus insatiable frenzy Our creature pauses to stare away Across to the eastern skyline No more stars will rise this night The coming dawn will never see... Gathering its trophies This bonehunters full awful glory With wingspread full it swallows the night And splits the faint twilight with flight A hoary legend burned into memory This creature of imagination... But burial stone speaks with clear voice Of a creature with gray scaled armour..."

"With uncertainty I ink my final thoughts on unlit blocks Niggas caught on heron nods Still at odds with false gods of archaic age Angelic face wretched with pain ignites my flame Your mundane daily life amazes me, such complacency Tattered city once brimming with life now sits abandoned Some feel these thoughts too random I hand them their empty heads as main course to DaVincis Last Supper As they sit and wonder Abundant sun pours over old steel and bricks Filling my aching eyes till they split I felt my earth shift, contort, and twist Lift heavy brow to view what happened to my tiny corner of dirt Worthless soul too old to care As despair builds thick amongst my people From burnt steeples hear distant toll of bells Ancient tongue swells as one lumbers with prenatal language Manage a coarse throaty mumble to convey how this earth crumbles I tumble, close to where Ive been a million times before Free to ignore pain which pounds at human temples I resemble less of a man and more the dirt I tread on, the truth I fed on To my trampled brethren Heaven wont accept you Either you or it dont exist Consider that a gift As we walk through that mist filled valley Vulnerable souls tell tales of ill proportions Scorching rise soothing moon, soon to dim My travels at an end, light bends to dark Jagged crossed sticks manhandled as scripture and art Picture your Christ as blond and blue eyed As mine resides within confines of empty glass bottles Robbed of youth I wobble past society and rest my head on curb of reality If only for a nap To grasp for that which we lack Remain trapped in these three dimensions Mention I once stepped past, now viewed as insane Trained human pets scurry to cubicals for food pellets Next funeral for those who think cause thoughts are relics I smell this viscous odor on each face I meet Seems humanity reached peak in 20th century My jaded eye strains to see through a smokefilled room Consumed by books which speak of our past At last begin to piece together our beginnings With few fleeting seconds til our end Quickly cross that bridge, you bum See whats on the other shore Its lure magnetic in our drunken minds Poor feeble shell hoping for so much more Left entranced by ancient dance of emptiness Few are the blessed who feed on truths breast"
"If we never meet again, Ill have a rose to remember The snows of December will bring you back to me If we never meet again, Ill fall asleep in the flowers And dream of the hours we spent in ecstasy The leaves in the fall will wreak all the beauty I found in your eyes The birds in the spring when they sing, will tell me that love never dies If we never meet again, as sure as heaven above you Forever Ill love you if we never meet again"
"Written by Louise Goffin, Bill Olvia Gerry Goffin There comes a time when I just dont know It always seems to happen when you go I need you standing by Every time you leave, it all seems wrong Something dies inside every time youre gone I need you standing by When youre with me, trouble fades away Love you give me is easy to repay Time wont stand still, you know its gonna fly But when time is without you . . It might as well pass by I got good love to give you But it aint gonna happen if you dont come through If you want me you gotta try You should know by now we dont have to compete Just like the time we met on that two way street Youll find out I speak no lie When youre with me, trouble fades away Love you give me is easy to repay But when time is without out . . Time wont stand still, you know its gonna fly It might as well pass by"

Fire of earth! Ancient gods! Cloak the... Oasis! From mortal sight... Trying to pave the way to my eternal goal, This pool of godly fluid, juice, granting life There is no passage for retreat, Too this journey was for going back... Further went the line of my sight, I saw a God in the sky. My humble soul, tired in its cage, Was now willing lo leave! From now I travelled without the burden of flesh For I was free in my thoughts and will, I could now reach the end... Lifes harder than that, Dream is like reality. Heat of wind! Fire of earth! Ancient gods! Cloak the... Oasis! From mortal sight... The taste of the holy essence gives me immortal life, I had dreamt of from the beginning of all. As said by the gods, this life is not for mortal beings, And they will feel the pain of disgrace!"

"On the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day. On the nature of extinct intermediate varieties on their number. On the vast lapse of time, as inferred from the rate of deposition and of denudation. On the poorness of our palaeontological collections. On the intermittence of geological formations. On the absence of intermediate varieties in any one formation. On the sudden appearance of groups of species. On their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous strata In the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might be justly urged against the views maintained in this volume. Most of them have now been discussed. One, namely the distinctness of specific forms, and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links, is a very obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons why such links do not commonly occur at the present day, under the circumstances apparently most favourable for their presence, namely on an extensive and continuous area with graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured to show, that the life of each species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on climate and, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. I endeavoured, also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and improvement. The main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends on the very process of natural selection, through which new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their parentforms. But just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed on the earth, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record In the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of intermediate forms must, on my theory, have formerly existed. I have found it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing to myself, forms DIRECTLY intermediate between them. But this is a wholly false view we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but unknown progenitor and the progenitor will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants. To give a simple illustration the fantail and pouter pigeons have both descended from the rockpigeon if we possessed all the intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an extremely close series between both and the rockpigeon but we should have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds. These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rockpigeon, whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species, such as C. oenas So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed directly intermediate between them, but between each and an unknown common parent. The common parent will have had in its whole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse but in some points of structure may have differed considerably from both, even perhaps more than they differ from each other. Hence in all such cases, we should be unable to recognise the parentform of any two or more species, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links It is just possible by my theory, that one of two living forms might have descended from the other for instance, a horse from a tapir and in this case DIRECT intermediate links will have existed between them. But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change and the principle of competition between organism and organism, between child and parent, will render this a very rare event for in all cases the new and improved forms of life will tend to supplant the old and unimproved forms By the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected with the parentspecies of each genus, by differences not greater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the present day and these parentspecies, now generally extinct, have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient species and so on backwards, always converging to the common ancestor of each great class. So that the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great. But assuredly, if this theory be true, such have lived upon this earth ON THE LAPSE OF TIME Independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely numerous connecting links, it may be objected, that time will not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all changes having been effected very slowly through natural selection. It is hardly possible for me even to recall to the reader, who may not be a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time. He who can read Sir Charles Lyells grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. Not that it suffices to study the Principles of Geology, or to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations, and to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation or even each stratum. A man must for years examine for himself great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the sea at work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment, before he can hope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time, the monuments of which we see around us It is good to wander along lines of seacoast, when formed of moderately hard rocks, and mark the process of degradation. The tides in most cases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles for there is reason to believe that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away rock. At last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and these remaining fixed, have to be worn away, atom by atom, until reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. But how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all thickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing degradation, we find that it is only here and there, along a short length or round a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time suffering. The appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base He who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores, will, I believe, be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts are worn away. The observations on this head by Hugh Miller, and by that excellent observer Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill, are most impressive. With the mind thus impressed, let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand feet in thickness, which, though probably formed at a quicker rate than many other deposits, yet, from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears the stamp of time, are good to show how slowly the mass has been accumulated. Let him remember Lyells profound remark, that the thickness and extent of sedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which the earths crust has elsewhere suffered. And what an amount of degradation is implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries! Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum thickness, in most cases from actual measurement, in a few cases from estimate, of each formation in different parts of Great Britain and this is the result Feet Palaeozoic strata not including igneous beds..57,154 Secondary strata................................13,190 Tertiary strata..................................2,240 making altogether 72,584 feet that is, very nearly thirteen and threequarters British miles. Some of these formations, which are represented in England by thin beds, are thousands of feet in thickness on the Continent. Moreover, between each successive formation, we have, in the opinion of most geologists, enormously long blank periods. So that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in Britain, gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation yet what time this must have consumed! Good observers have estimated that sediment is deposited by the great Mississippi river at the rate of only 600 feet in a hundred thousand years. This estimate may be quite erroneous yet, considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is transported by the currents of the sea, the process of accumulation in any one area must be extremely slow But the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered, independently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter, probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time. I remember having been much struck with the evidence of denudation, when viewing volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height for the gentle slope of the lavastreams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same story is still more plainly told by faults,those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet for since the crust cracked, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the sea, that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible The Craven fault, for instance, extends for upwards of 30 miles, and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from 600 to 3000 feet. Professor Ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in Anglesea of 2300 feet and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in Merionethshire of 12,000 feet yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly swept away. The consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity I am tempted to give one other case, the wellknown one of the denudation of the Weald. Though it must be admitted that the denudation of the Weald has been a mere trifle, in comparison with that which has removed masses of our palaeozoic strata, in parts ten thousand feet in thickness, as shown in Professor Ramsays masterly memoir on this subject. Yet it is an admirable lesson to stand on the North Downs and to look at the distant South Downs for, remembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet and close, one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks which must have covered up the Weald within so limited a period as since the latter part of the Chalk formation. The distance from the northern to the southern Downs is about 22 miles, and the thickness of the several formations is on an average about 1100 feet, as I am informed by Professor Ramsay. But if, as some geologists suppose, a range of older rocks underlies the Weald, on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere, the above estimate would be erroneous but this source of doubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the district. If, then, we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height, we could measure the time requisite to have denuded the Weald. This, of course, cannot be done but we may, in order to form some crude notion on the subject, assume that the sea would eat into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century. This will at first appear much too small an allowance but it is the same as if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twentytwo years. I doubt whether any rock, even as soft as chalk, would yield at this rate excepting on the most exposed coasts though no doubt the degradation of a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen fragments. On the other hand, I do not believe that any line of coast, ten or twenty miles in length, ever suffers degradation at the same time along its whole indented length and we must remember that almost all strata contain harder layers or nodules, which from long resisting attrition form a breakwater at the base. Hence, under ordinary circumstances, I conclude that for a cliff 500 feet in height, a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be an ample allowance. At this rate, on the above data, the denudation of the Weald must have required 306,662,400 years or say three hundred million years The action of fresh water on the gently inclined Wealden district, when upraised, could hardly have been great, but it would somewhat reduce the above estimate. On the other hand, during oscillations of level, which we know this area has undergone, the surface may have existed for millions of years as land, and thus have escaped the action of the sea when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods, it would, likewise, have escaped the action of the coastwaves. So that in all probability a far longer period than 300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of the Secondary period I have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain some notion, however imperfect, of the lapse of years. During each of these years, over the whole world, the land and the water has been peopled by hosts of living forms. What an infinite number of generations, which the mind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other in the long roll of years! Now turn to our richest geological museums, and what a paltry display we behold! ON THE POORNESS OF OUR PALAEONTOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS That our palaeontological collections are very imperfect, is admitted by every one. The remark of that admirable palaeontologist, the late Edward Forbes, should not be forgotten, namely, that numbers of our fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens collected on some one spot. Only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove. No organism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. I believe we are continually taking a most erroneous view, when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a formation conformably covered, after an enormous interval of time, by another and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will when the beds are upraised generally be dissolved by the percolation of rainwater. I suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach between high and low watermark are preserved. For instance, the several species of the Chthamalinae a subfamily of sessile cirripedes coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers they are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation yet it is now known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the chalk period. The molluscan genus Chiton offers a partially analogous case With respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the Secondary and Palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our evidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree. For instance, not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast periods, with one exception discovered by Sir C. Lyell in the carboniferous strata of North America. In regard to mammiferous remains, a single glance at the historical table published in the Supplement to Lyells Manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is their preservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their rarity surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine deposits and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations But the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another and more important cause than any of the foregoing namely, from the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals of time. When we see the formations tabulated in written works, or when we follow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive. But we know, for instance, from Sir R. Murchisons great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are in that country between the superimposed formations so it is in North America, and in many other parts of the world. The most skilful geologist, if his attention had been exclusively confined to these large territories, would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country, great piles of sediment, charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had elsewhere been accumulated. And if in each separate territory, hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive formations, we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained. The frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition of consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment has been derived, accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between each formation But we can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region are almost invariably intermittent that is, have not followed each other in close sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many hundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been upraised several hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological period. Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a peculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so scantily developed, that no record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a distant age. A little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of the western side of South America, no extensive formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found, though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from the enormous degradation of the coastrocks and from muddy streams entering the sea. The explanation, no doubt, is, that the littoral and sublittoral deposits are continually worn away, as soon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of the coastwaves We may, I think, safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the incessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level. Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two ways either, in profound depths of the sea, in which case, judging from the researches of E. Forbes, we may conclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals, and the mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then existed or, sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life, and thus a fossiliferous formation thick enough, when upraised, to resist any amount of degradation, may be formed I am convinced that all our ancient formations, which are rich in fossils, have thus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my views on this subject in 1845, I have watched the progress of Geology, and have been surprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that great formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during subsidence. I may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west coast of South America, which has been bulky enough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will hardly last to a distant geological age, was certainly deposited during a downward oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations have affected wide spaces. Consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, may have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay. On the other hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, THICK deposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are the most favourable to life. Still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of elevation or, to speak more accurately, the beds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within the limits of the coastaction Thus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered intermittent. I feel much confidence in the truth of these views, for they are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by Sir C. Lyell and E. Forbes independently arrived at a similar conclusion One remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of elevation the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be increased, and new stations will often be formedall circumstances most favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties and species but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the geological record. On the other hand, during subsidence, the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease excepting the productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago, and consequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction, fewer new varieties or species will be formed and it is during these very periods of subsidence, that our great deposits rich in fossils have been accumulated. Nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linking forms From the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect but if we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes more difficult to understand, why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close. Some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, but, as they are rare, they may be here passed over. Although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition, I can see several reasons why each should not include a graduated series of links between the species which then lived but I can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following considerations Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each perhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another. I am aware that two palaeontologists, whose opinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the average duration of specific forms. But insuperable difficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head. When we see a species first appearing in the middle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed. So again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited, it would be equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct. We forget how small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been correlated with perfect accuracy With marine animals of all kinds, we may safely infer a large amount of migration during climatal and other changes and when we see a species first appearing in any formation, the probability is that it only then first immigrated into that area. It is well known, for instance, that several species appeared somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic beds of North America than in those of Europe time having apparently been required for their migration from the American to the European seas. In examining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing species are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea or, conversely, that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this particular deposit. It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the Glacial period, which forms only a part of one whole geological period and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level, on the inordinately great change of climate, on the prodigious lapse of time, all included within this same glacial period. Yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world, sedimentary deposits, INCLUDING FOSSIL REMAINS, have gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period. It is not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish for we know what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of America during this space of time. When such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at different levels, owing to the migration of species and to geographical changes. And in the distant future, a geologist examining these beds, might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period, instead of having been really far greater, that is extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on accumulating for a very long period, in order to have given sufficient time for the slow process of variation hence the deposit will generally have to be a very thick one and the species undergoing modification will have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time. But we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of subsidence and to keep the depth approximately the same, which is necessary in order to enable the same species to live on the same space, the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount of subsidence. But this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movement continues. In fact, this nearly exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency for it has been observed by more than one palaeontologist, that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower limits It would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of formations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its accumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed of beds of different mineralogical composition, we may reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted, as a change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will generally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time. Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which its deposition has consumed. Many instances could be given of beds only a few feet in thickness, representing formations, elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their accumulation yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. Many cases could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded, submerged, and then recovered by the upper beds of the same formation,facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have occurred in its accumulation. In other cases we have the plainest evidence in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition, which would never even have been suspected, had not the trees chanced to have been preserved thus, Messrs. Lyell and Dawson found carboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient rootbearing strata, one above the other, at no less than sixtyeight different levels. Hence, when the same species occur at the bottom, middle, and top of a formation, the probability is that they have not lived on the same spot during the whole period of deposition, but have disappeared and reappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period. So that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification during any one geological period, a section would not probably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed between them, but abrupt, though perhaps very slight, changes of form It is allimportant to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by which to distinguish species and varieties they grant some little variability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species, unless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate gradations. And this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section. Supposing B and C to be two species, and a third, A, to be found in an underlying bed even if A were strictly intermediate between B and C, it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at the same time it could be most closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties. Nor should it be forgotten, as before explained, that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet might not at all necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points of structure. So that we might obtain the parentspecies and its several modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should not recognise their relationship, and should consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species It is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palaeontologists have founded their species and they do this the more readily if the specimens come from different substages of the same formation. Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of DOrbigny and others into the rank of varieties and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find. Moreover, if we look to rather wider intervals, namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation, we find that the embedded fossils, though almost universally ranked as specifically different, yet are far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in more widely separated formations but to this subject I shall have to return in the following chapter One other consideration is worth notice with animals and plants that can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally at first local and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parentforms until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree. According to this view, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for the successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot. Most marine animals have a wide range and we have seen that with plants it is those which have the widest range, that oftenest present varieties so that with shells and other marine animals, it is probably those which have had the widest range, far exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of Europe, which have oftenest given rise, first to local varieties and ultimately to new species and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation It should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect specimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species, until many specimens have been collected from many places and in the case of fossil species this could rarely be effected by palaeontologists. We shall, perhaps, best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future period will be able to prove, that our different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks or, again, whether certain seashells inhabiting the shores of North America, which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their European representatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are really varieties or are, as it is called, specifically distinct. This could be effected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations and such success seems to me improbable in the highest degree Geological research, though it has added numerous species to existing and extinct genera, and has made the intervals between some few groups less wide than they otherwise would have been, yet has done scarcely anything in breaking down the distinction between species, by connecting them together by numerous, fine, intermediate varieties and this not having been effected, is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the many objections which may be urged against my views. Hence it will be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks, under an imaginary illustration. The Malay Archipelago is of about the size of Europe from the North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia and therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined with any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America. I fully agree with Mr. GodwinAusten, that the present condition of the Malay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, when most of our formations were accumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one of the richest regions of the whole world in organic beings yet if all the species were to be collected which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world! But we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. I suspect that not many of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked submarine rocks, would be embedded and those embedded in gravel or sand, would not endure to a distant epoch. Wherever sediment did not accumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could be preserved In our archipelago, I believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed of sufficient thickness to last to an age, as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie in the past, only during periods of subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be separated from each other by enormous intervals, during which the area would be either stationary or rising whilst rising, each fossiliferous formation would be destroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant coastaction, as we now see on the shores of South America. During the periods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life during the periods of elevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record would then be least perfect It may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would EXCEED the average duration of the same specific forms and these contingencies are indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations between any two or more species. If such gradations were not fully preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct species. It is, also, probable that each great period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level, and that slight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate, and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one formation Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands of miles beyond its confines and analogy leads me to believe that it would be chiefly these farranging species which would oftenest produce new varieties and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined to one place, but if possessed of any decided advantage, or when further modified and improved, they would slowly spread and supplant their parentforms. When such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they would differ from their former state, in a nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely slight degree, they would, according to the principles followed by many palaeontologists, be ranked as new and distinct species If then, there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right to expect to find in our geological formations, an infinite number of those fine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life. We ought only to look for a few links, some more closely, some more distantly related to each other and these links, let them be ever so close, if found in different stages of the same formation, would, by most palaeontologists, be ranked as distinct species. But I do not pretend that I should ever have suspected how poor a record of the mutations of life, the best preserved geological section presented, had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on my theory ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF WHOLE GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists, for instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and by none more forcibly than by Professor Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection. For the development of a group of forms, all of which have descended from some one progenitor, must have been an extremely slow process and the progenitors must have lived long ages before their modified descendants. But we continually overrate the perfection of the geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not exist before that stage. We continually forget how large the world is, compared with the area over which our geological formations have been carefully examined we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of Europe and of the United States. We do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time, which have probably elapsed between our consecutive formations,longer perhaps in some cases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation. These intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from some one or some few parentforms and in the succeeding formation such species will appear as if suddenly created I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely that it might require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line of life, for instance to fly through the air but that when this had been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and widely throughout the world I will now give a few examples to illustrate these remarks and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species have suddenly been produced. I may recall the wellknown fact that in geological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series. And now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary series and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series. Cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum but now extinct species have been discovered in India, South America, and in Europe even as far back as the eocene stage. The most striking case, however, is that of the Whale family as these animals have huge bones, are marine, and range over the world, the fact of not a single bone of a whale having been discovered in any secondary formation, seemed fully to justify the belief that this great and distinct order had been suddenly produced in the interval between the latest secondary and earliest tertiary formation. But now we may read in the Supplement to Lyells Manual, published in 1858, clear evidence of the existence of whales in the upper greensand, some time before the close of the secondary period I may give another instance, which from having passed under my own eyes has much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I have stated that, from the number of existing and extinct tertiary species from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting various zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised from all these circumstances, I inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would certainly have been preserved and discovered and as not one species had been discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series. This was a sore trouble to me, adding as I thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. But my work had hardly been published, when a skilful palaeontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the chalk of Belgium. And, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this sessile cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum. Hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary period and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our many tertiary and existing species The case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the teleostean fishes, low down in the Chalk period. This group includes the large majority of existing species. Lately, Professor Pictet has carried their existence one substage further back and some palaeontologists believe that certain much older fishes, of which the affinities are as yet imperfectly known, are really teleostean. Assuming, however, that the whole of them did appear, as Agassiz believes, at the commencement of the chalk formation, the fact would certainly be highly remarkable but I cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory, unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this same period. It is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossilfish are known from south of the equator and by running through Pictets Palaeontology it will be seen that very few species are known from several formations in Europe. Some few families of fish now have a confined range the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely developed in some one sea, might have spread widely. Nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from south to north as they are at present. Even at this day, if the Malay Archipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great group of marine animals might be multiplied and here they would remain confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or Australia, and thus reach other and distant seas From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States and from the revolution in our palaeontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES IN THE LOWEST KNOWN FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA There is another and allied difficulty, which is much graver. I allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same group, suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. Most of the arguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group have descended from one progenitor, apply with nearly equal force to the earliest known species. For instance, I cannot doubt that all the Silurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean, which must have lived long before the Silurian age, and which probably differed greatly from any known animal. Some of the most ancient Silurian animals, as the Nautilus, Lingula, etc., do not differ much from living species and it cannot on my theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong, for they do not present characters in any degree intermediate between them. If, moreover, they had been the progenitors of these orders, they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous and improved descendants Consequently, if my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the lowest Silurian stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Silurian age to the present day and that during these vast, yet quite unknown, periods of time, the world swarmed with living creatures To the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods, I can give no satisfactory answer. Several of the most eminent geologists, with Sir R. Murchison at their head, are convinced that we see in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the dawn of life on this planet. Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and the late E. Forbes, dispute this conclusion. We should not forget that only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy. M. Barrande has lately added another and lower stage to the Silurian system, abounding with new and peculiar species. Traces of life have been detected in the Longmynd beds beneath Barrandes socalled primordial zone. The presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks, probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods. But the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata, which on my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the Silurian epoch, is very great. If these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation, or obliterated by metamorphic action, we ought to find only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age, and these ought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition. But the descriptions which we now possess of the Silurian deposits over immense territories in Russia and in North America, do not support the view, that the older a formation is, the more it has suffered the extremity of denudation and metamorphism The case at present must remain inexplicable and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it may hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following hypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains, which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe and of the United States and from the amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents of Europe and North America. But we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals between the successive formations whether Europe and the United States during these intervals existed as dry land, or as a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not deposited, or again as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea Looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the land, we see them studded with many islands but not one oceanic island is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palaeozoic or secondary formation. Hence we may perhaps infer, that during the palaeozoic and secondary periods, neither continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans now extend for had they existed there, palaeozoic and secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level, which we may fairly conclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods. If then we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record and on the other hand, that where continents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level, since the earliest silurian period. The coloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents areas of elevation. But have we any right to assume that things have thus remained from eternity? Our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance, during many oscillations of level, of the force of elevation but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages? At a period immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are now spread out and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now stand. Nor should we be justified in assuming that if, for instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a continent, we should there find formations older than the silurian strata, supposing such to have been formerly deposited for it might well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always remained nearer to the surface. The immense areas in some parts of the world, for instance in South America, of bare metamorphic rocks, which must have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to require some special explanation and we may perhaps believe that we see in these large areas, the many formations long anterior to the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition The several difficulties here discussed, namely our not finding in the successive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the many species which now exist or have existed the sudden manner in which whole groups of species appear in our European formations the almost entire absence, as at present known, of fossiliferous formations beneath the Silurian strata, are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature. We see this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent palaeontologists, namely Cuvier, Owen, Agassiz, Barrande, Falconer, E. Forbes, etc., and all our greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, etc., have unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the immutability of species. But I have reason to believe that one great authority, Sir Charles Lyell, from further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject. I feel how rash it is to differ from these great authorities, to whom, with others, we owe all our knowledge. Those who think the natural geological record in any degree perfect, and who do not attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds given in this volume, will undoubtedly at once reject my theory. For my part, following out Lyells metaphor, I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved and of each page, only here and there a few lines. Each word of the slowlychanging language, in which the history is supposed to be written, being more or less different in the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the apparently abruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our consecutive, but widely separated formations. On this view, the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear"

"Its just a somber day riding in the saddle Riding on top iron horses straight into battle Collateral damage has yet to be reprimanded Hiding in these stations to be slaughtered just like were cattle But were handed opportunity to change our destination Manifest destiny undergoing manifestation And with no hesitation, we charge upon the masses Tools for the elite who laugh, watch and raise their glasses Gaze so passively past reasons inauguration Catch ear of rebellion they trash the conversation So I try to keep it simple, Im a mere infidel Please look at my honesty, I dont deserve a prison cell Love has fallen in the well, please throw down a rope If the marriage is arranged, please expect me to elope To a sanctuary where I can admit my matrimony And end the cycle of oppression that has made me oh so lonely Aint it mean? Strangest thing youve ever seen Would you look at how they swing Oh Would you look at how they swing? But they aint dead though No I didnt die yall I cut myself down And I admire my fall into grace Left the wild west to gain some understanding I dont see why we start off in the air then glide down to the ground With spikes on every landing, to burst any bubbles Impair the swift movement, havent even made it subtle But force it down throats of those unwilling to accept Punish those who admit their fears and tears whenever they confess Blessings are messes, discouragement of the guesses To ever be tested in laboratory settings, then messaged To the people who can change the lives of those who suffer Biting my tongue takes every bit of strength that I can muster When I wanna say Uncover, turn those maids to Bubbas mother Take the hero out the Nino sensibility obscene You talk about progressing, and youre looked at as extreme All alliances are trashed, watered down to simple teams We dont stick to a theme, but its one of many fads And thats why I wander through the city every night going mad Aint it mean? Strangest thing youve ever seen Would you look at how they swing Oh Would you look at how they swing? But they aint dead though No I didnt die yall I cut myself down And I admire my fall into grace"

Warfare, the method and device. Four ugly years of mass killing. 30 million lives wiped from this Earth. Flesh and Blood The fearless fight and never die. Red soldiers fight until the death. Summoned to defend against evil. Smashed by Stalins hand. Flesh and Blood Quiet on the Eastern front. The silence is deafening. The calm before the storm. Disrupt the enemy. Fighting and blood shed. Obliterate life. Pulverize, stop the attack. Demolish, expedite the conflict. Decimate the crusade."

"We stand at the edge, just behind the shadows. Ahead of the eclipse, with darkness and void. All the keys of paradise flew into the abyss. Dark Demon of Hell once again came down to us. The black sky, the voices in your head. You have paid for their sins. Domination came to an end on this land. No one will hear your plaintive screams. Lava swallowed the Earth And your fetid soul. Only the ash is smoking. This poor world is destroyed. Shed blood spread out along the rivers. Everything has plunged into eternal rest. The sounds have merged in unison. Wake up. The dream is over."

I couldnt help but notice that near the corner of your mouth There was a piece of food escaping it was trying to stay out I started thinking about myself like I always seem to do I couldnt stop myself from saying what might seem theatrical to you Its just that I dont want anymore Remote and dark years no more remote and dark years Its like there were these bottles near the end of my street They were escaping into the sewer near my feet So I picked them up and I flattened them and I pushed them through the grates I know it seems unrelated but Im trying to relate to you That I dont want anymore remote and dark years no more remote and dark years
"Events of recent history indicate that Americans are setting a course for the end of their own great nation. The ever growing trend in this country is to judge people, not by their individual character, but by their identity as a member of a specific group No one has ever succeeded or failed in life as a result of their group affiliation A persons success or failure is also not based on luck, but on the sum total of the decisions that they have made. Those who succeed do so through good work ethic and their wise use of their power to choose The opposite is true for those who fail The ideals of individual accountability and responsibility in the United States are dying everyday. A gun cannot be responsible for a death, just as a shovel cannot be responsible for digging a ditch Both are only tools, that have no will of their own Responsibility is an adjunct through conscious choice and is the price we pay for freedom Freedom is also a tool It is an essential tool needed by human beings if they are to prosper, rather than to merely survive. Yet there are those who would rather trade their freedom for security Some believe that it is the responsibility of government to provide for you In truth, we form government to ensure and protect the freedom that is already inherently ours"

"Rising sun is just beginning Poseidon seems appeased today The sea is calm, the breeze slight My ship glides slowly over the water Ive been lost for many times Ive been waiting for many months to come back in my country After our victory over the Trojan enemy Me... Ulysses... searching for the road of salvation! Today, arises another trial Wizard Medea has warned me of the danger The peril of sailing near Anthemoessa Island Land inhabited by malefic creatures Birds women, cruel virgins, famous sirens Who charmed the most intrepid sailors To wreck them on reefs And devour them with no mercy I have undergone many hardships... I have defeated many monsters... But this time... how could I struggle against such deadly angels? How resist their bewitching voices? Their so captivating and perfidious tunes? Me... Ulysses... searching for the road of salvation! Setting sun is just beginning The sea is abnormally quiet and there is a sudden breeze A breathless calm settles on the waves And my crew is seized by terror Here we are! Sirens are approaching... Only I can resist their dangerous organ I make my companions plug their ears with wax And make them tie me to the ship mast Ordering to them to tie it tighter Every time I moan for them to release me Under the hold of this terrible malediction Their admirable voices fill my heart with the desire to listen I will not resist... Please, unchain me! But more I scream, more my sailors tighten even more The ties that imprison me While the rest of the crew rows even more forcefully To leave this damned island Me... Ulysses... once again I have won! I have survived the terrible sirens! Now, can I continue my destiny And find at last... the road of salvation!"

No time yet they must hunted gathered herded. Object of terror I force my will upon them. The flash of my blade that leaves their children dead. Will see them fall to their knees slaves to my sadistic fantasies. And Im still hungry. Gather the dead for I must feast on these flesh bodies still dripping with fluids. Erect a monument, a testament, to the one godking to be worshiped. A tree the height of fifty men, toiled endlessly and adorn by bones. These people I have slaughtered and consumed. Hail to the usurped heavenly throne. Gore bathed soil. Sifting through the blood of their families. Fear of being the next one to be boiled and disgustingly slurped down my chin. Will be the next of your kin. A monument of subjugation Obey me or suffer eternally Confluence of flesh constructed With haste A desperate attempt to Appease and delay their fate To stave my wrath one more day Such pitiful ignorance Unquenchable appetite never sated The end to all Is in sight Carving a totem pole atop blood mountain whilst enslaving the local mountain folk population as cattle"

"This is the song for Baby Birch I will never know you And at the back of what weve done There is the knowledge of you Well I wish we could take every path Could spend a hundred years Adoring you Yes, I wish we could take every path Cause you know I hated to close The door on you Do you remember staring Up at the stars So far away in their bulletproof cars? When we heard the rushing, slow intake Of the dark, dark water And the engine breaks And I said How about them engine breaks? And, if I should die before I wake Will you keep an eye on Baby Birch? Because Id hate to see her Make the same mistake When it was dark I called and you came When it was dark, I saw shapes When I see stars, I feel, in your hand And I see stars And I reel, again Well mercy me. Ill be goddamned Its been a long, long time Since I last saw you And I have never known the plan Its been a long, long time How are you? Your eyes are green. Your hair is gold Your hair is black. Your eyes are blue I closed the ranks, and I doubled back But, you know I hated to close The doggone door on you We take a walk along the dirty lake Hear the goose Cussing at me over her eggs You poor little cousin I dont want your dregs A little baby fussing over my legs There is a blacksmith And there is a shepherd And there is a butcherboy And there is a barber, whos cutting And cutting away at my only joy I saw a rabbit As slick as a knife And as pale as a candlestick And I had thought itd be harder to do But I caught her, and skinned her quick Held her there Kicking and mewling Upended, unspooling, unsung and blue Told her Wherever you go Little runaway bunny I will find you. And then she ran As theyre liable to do Be at peace baby, and be gone Be at peace baby, and be gone"

Climbing Climbing A mountain so cragged and tall Sure is a long way back down Flying Flying On toy rockets pointed at mars Sure is a long way back down We could find a second sun Or be burned on the way And loose another few Tomorrows on its way Driving Driving On a road headed nowhere at all And it just keeps on going Waiting Waiting For the cold wind of winter to calm And it just keeps on blowing We could drive another mile We could wait one more day And loose another few Tomorrows on its way Do you find it kind of stifling Could be everythings not only what theyre showing Do you find it kind of trifling Looks like everything is what they think theyre owning lies Do you find it kind of criminal Do you think that its the only thing theyre planning for you Once we were giving Now we are taking We left a more beautiful world than were making Once we were building Now we are breaking Time to clean up all the mess weve been making Lay down your hand grenades Throw down your rifles Now is the time to make peace with your rivals and Love Love Love Love Love We could fight another fight But its all in vain And loose another few Tomorrow can explain We could drive another mile We could wait one more day And loose another few Tomorrows on its way
"This is the pain And Ive felt it for days. Its ripping my heart in two. Searching for another sound. Cant put my feet back on the ground. Are you listening? I never thought that I would see this happening But even through the darkest nights There was one shining light To take away the pain Desperate for answers And the quest for something better Was all that I could seek Though Id fallen through the spaces In the darkest of places You never let go of me. This is the truth and Ive found it in you This wont be my final bow Death and decay or the sting of the grave Cant touch me now These are the answers to all of the questions I never found in me. That its by your grace that I have been saved I have been set free And so, I will scream with everything til theres no breath left in me Jesus your name is all that I need. You have set. You have set me free."

Stuck in the place where people go to be forgotten So go be forgotten Difficult to acknowledge completion Time fades to grey I sit and stare at the future Stuck still Letting it all pass Amidst the shaking Death winds snake their way forth Trembling with the earth tonight Life functions on and will survive Organic matter shall again arrive at consciousness Planning what and how to sacrifice All is not possible Leaving behind the pleasures Better for it perhaps Scorching an era of evolution away Go be forgotten

And it hurts so much to think of how she lied I shared everything to the very last penny Somethin that you really cant do with many Since this young lady was such a big winner Id treat her all the time to a candle light dinner Have a violinist play a real sweet song And she never showed a sign that somethin was wrong My boy used to say Man Shan, Id quit her But she seemed so happy every time Im with her We used to hold hands and walk in the rain And on the days I felt down she eased my pain This was just too farfetched to believe To think that my girl would just up and leave Imagine that I just couldnt Cause I knew deep down in my heart she wouldnt All of a sudden a lot of things changed She started actin funny, I mean a bit strange We had little squabbles, arguments, fights Wild stories in the days and stayed out nights Id say, Baby, where you been for all that time?

"[Verse] I guess its not too late to find another niche No Always wished I woulda died when I was 26 Ah Laid up in the sheets with a honeydip Not a worry in my mind cause I quit Stressed raps and sounds that make pounds and props Feelin like Im bound to these downtown blocks I dont know nobody guwapd up, Im livin in a trapped up in the city limits Every minute, lots of shit I never finished I dont even want a little smidgen All these critics try to tell me my music is a shitty gimmick Shit it, Im just spitting for the fuck of spitting I aint worried about some idiots that caught up in the analytics Never liked the limelight, never was compatible Only press you gettin outta Ugly is the lateral People too concerned with strictly adding up their capital But dollars are collapsible, so yall aint even rational But just to keep my motives in the open Never wanted no exposure, never needed to be noticed Never bothered with promotion, kept the photo out of focus The mental state was humble, though the rhymes was braggadocious Wandered with my hoodie up down narcissistic avenues Vastly captivated, turnin rappin into stacking loot But why pursue that gratitude if nothing is a absolute? They aptitude is too acute to navigate my attributes Yup But Im way too impatient to wait for stupid vacant disgraces to wake This the human race and yall standing in place, its a waste Its the age of information and all the truth and all the lies Are just there for the taking The temporary and ancient, face it, youre basic Safe and complacent, youll never escape it Totally okay with being under surveillance This is not praising the foil hats Yall are obvious monkeys, go crawl back to your bunkers And boil rats for your lunches Shit is too far out of your clutches Your protests and disruptions just confuse all the dunces Anyone with brain function already deduced all your hunches The skys blue bitch, give me newer assumptions Im in the Unabomber shack with a Buddha sack Cause the rap games neutered and truly whack Cause rappers milk every last drop til their hooters flat Nursing off the same dead putrefied titty I dont remember tellin you that you could ride wit me"

"When the world you know is grey, and grief is all you feel, Whats one supposed to do? He walked these empty streets, no feelings lined his face, Cruel peacefulness... SILENCE!! PAIN! and... SORROW!!! He tries to understand the scenes, And day after day he fails, until, vividly clear it comes to only one way, Ill end it now, no doubts impede my thought, The real world around us wont forgive what we take lightly, The sorrow that we make is so real, We try to fight us, but weve got no way of fighting, This perfect pain, oh, sweet ignorance. Lay to bed at night, feeling all is well, Satisfied with what you did today, But what you did not do, reflects more who you are, So tell me, are you really satisfied?! ARE YOU... SATISFIED?!? Lie to yourself, lie to your god, look in my eyes and smile! This is just a beginning to your private paradise, Just wait and see what the future holds for you, And when the time is right, and all the pieces fit, Keep trying hard, but youll never swallow... ...your own shit... the sorrow that we make is so real... Swallow what we made to be so real!! the real world around us wont forgive what we take lightly... We try to fight us, but weve got no way of fighting, Now this is all, this emptiness, this pain!!! the real world around us wont forgive what we take lightly... When theres nothing left to cling to, when theres nothing more to gain, the real world around us wont forgive what we take lightly... PAIN!"

"Crowded against one another, or penned into an artifical environment. Unbearable lonliness, separated from their fellow creatures contact. Individual innocent beings, each cow, sheep, pig, goat or chicken. Viewed as a product to processed. Raised only to be slaughtered and consumed. Murdered victims enshrouded with false names that deny their suffering. Beef, mutton, pork and poultry. Creatures torn and butchered only for the petiness of the flavour of their decaying flesh. The carnage of the slaughterhouse is all completely unnecessary for sustenance of techonologically advanced mankind. Constantly brainwashed from the beginning to believe the opposite of this truth. The brutality is anacceptable. I strive to end the exploitation. Morality dictates. Morality dictates. Morality dictates. Morality dictates that I live vegan."

The one mans band created by Diego Voges after a little time on hold, is back now with Syndel which stamps the album cover on vocals too."

"Running on fire while your mind is set ablaze But whats the service you get in return? They enter your mind and force you to kneel and believe For unbelievers certainly will burn The doctrine of fear of deceit and suppression Is all thats ever counted as true And those who oppose will suffer and face their end The executioner is you Dont they dare to refuse and keep their ways Make them obey your laws They turned you into a ravaging tool of hate For power calls for force Youre part of the vile pillaging host And with them youll fight their wars No remorse Burn the blasphemic heretics Your creed Is all theyll ever need Will they bow their heads or die in vain Mercys reduced to mere memory It is of no avail for their violent reign March! March! March across their broken spines A valiant deaths man you are Lead by their rule, its justified Executing orders, you fail to notice That ages go by, how many have died? Their blood, their tears Their suffering Thats the price! Redemptions for sale! Salvation is granted, let true faith prevail Fire, all the world is set ablaze By now you feel the pain of righteousness Fed up by the killing, you were caught showing sympathy Youre scarred by the truth, they made you confess The doctrine of fear of deceit and suppression Now that you opposed, youll suffer and face your end Defamed, arrested and tormented then sentenced to death You realize, you worshipped a false god Feel the injustice that youve brought Youve been betrayed by their false cause"

"Hell! This is the black moment of the full moon Runing in the woods , looking for the weapons Sitting on my knees , the victim in my hands bleeding Screaming for mercy! All around inversed crosses Dripping blood on the wall Staring at me ,with their souls! Getting my power from their souls Im collecting those souls ,who betrayed me In war! This is satans war!!! Of the demons!! Satan captured me , burned my soul in hell Father is staring, say to the genie This is your messenger, help him Help him to find those angels of god Who betrayed him Blood red holy land Jerusalem!!!! Help me to find The burnt souls in Arallus hell Open the gate to Arallu Messiah of all evil This is satans war!!!"
"It just never ends. Lied to another friend. Missed another call. The lights and the phone turned off. Keep it all to myself and lie when Im asked if I need help. I smile so you cant tell. Now, I scream the things I could never say. Naked and alone, cling to the memories that I made. And you dream, because you no longer pray. The smile on my face, is a mask engraved with your name. Already broken, but still pretend I can bend. Selfishness determines who I still call a friend. Living in my own hell. The lies have built me a cell. How long its been, I honestly could not tell. Its time to go home and you still dont know how I really feel or what it is that you did wrong. So I scream the things I could never say. Naked and alone, cling to the memories that I made. And you dream, because you no longer pray. The smile on my face was a mask engraved with your name."
"Only awake... Another break in the river of time My snakes tongue Added to smouldering fire Fire of hate Destroys the bond so strong I find myself again on the edge Asking why Mother, answer me its my snakes mouth It could be all different now But the time walks forward Just such a little impulse A little part of me To rectify it all Will be hopeless Neither just a little spark of hope Asking why My snakes tongue imposed The loss of trust Remorses oppress me I tempted unstable soul I tempted the evil Dreadful theatre Tears in my eyes The little spark went out Oh mother Why just me Its my snakes tongue Its out of control Therefore Im suffering now I pray for forgiveness Give me one more chance My snakes tongue Will be damned"
"In the eternal land, In the sadness land, In the sadoland, In the lesbians land, In the suicidals land, In the sepulchral land Just see immortal angels in majestic flights And the swords be torn in the air, See hideous nereids be raised of the seas foams, Hear the dramatic, distant and taciturn howls of the wolves See Medusa smiling in front of petrified foolish men, Hear trembling and moribund voices And the wisdom of the ancient messages Its the divine unconsciousness Listening sepulchral whispers... ...Of a deep melancholys state Feel the coldness of the serenity, Feel the winds crossing your soul And the sweet smell of wines perfumed in the taverns In a poetic suicide in the name of Loucyfer, From the gates of Langsuyar, the death is the war The death is the war"
"[Verse 1] Black or the blue, red again Im moving on soon as you giving in Stuck in a conversation Tired of waiting I seen it all before Peering out the back door Peeling off the paint What you even call for?

You say Im a dreamer I aint got no proof I aint got no proof [Verse 2] Maybe Ill be fine if I just split the truth up Maybe Im just trying to tear it all down Maybe you could be the one that I change Maybe you could be the one to break me out Truth is, Im tired of looking up Bruising my chest Losing my breath again Again, again [Chorus] You say youre a lover Whats the mean to you? You say Im a dreamer I aint got no proof I aint got no proof [Verse 3] So Ill be fine, go ahead go take it Wish me well, standing on my station You always get yours, I know you do Sent a little money said it dont go through I guess you think you the only one Its me against the world and I dont owe you none Boulder on my back I swear it weights up couple stacks See I lift a ton Bet you think you thought you knew enough Is it cold or what? [Outro] I caught on slow I can feel how they feel how they like me now Im just stuck in my throat Something in the air going lock me down Move it like Im selling bass They want to taste it Tighten up do what you say Know your place kid Oh I know, I know, I know Oh I know, I know, I know"
Gathered in circle Gods decide The fate of men that had the courage To seek for the unkonn The path was written with stars And they chosen to transform Those worlds in reality Not fearing the seas The sailors follow up A quest of adventures A new land in sight A power divine Another dimension Now the know The force of Gods That leads the way to heaven As time goes by They know theyll find The hidden gate to glory But not all Gods were on their side The fear of Baco was the power That those men could achieve They were successful on their fight Not even storms could ever stop What the concilium decides
"Yo Brain freeze in a dead car, Carcass is lying On the left floor, minus the headscar Rise up through the dark, Parcels in night Like a shark fin targeting deadstop roadkill Still no thrills on this park bench Litres a halfrate liquor tank distill my wordplay Words get slurred at a rate like vermin Emerge and create my murmurs, the first day Burn lands, shake hands with the Wicker Man Give your thanks, still nose deep in a shitty gram Magazines torn into parcels for oblong cocktails Dust racked up as the city sang deeper Than thousands of leagues like bass Is the amount is the TNT by the crateload Deviants stuck in the crime scene Bathing the scum of the streets sides Searching for fake gold Dusk plus one gets stubbed on the tarmac Lungs ripple, rough, burn, chest hurts Life in the coal mines Lurk in the piss with the demons Thats where my soul lies Creeping on cold nights Swallowing swords in a slipstream nightmare Night prayers Sprint from the door of the house fire Dousing the streets in DeLorean time trails Match in the gas tank, boom boom, cant fail I have dreams that Im standing alone At the steps of the next life And my last words harness The murderous targets missed Before my next big breathe, Die Split second respite, flaming inferno Great lengths bulge in the weight of my turncoat Tainted and turn in the fruitbowl Taint in the fruitbowl Wait in line to nose dive straight into the wormhole I watched the door close behind you And I walked on to the water I see fire on the horizon And I know who your name These are the minutes from the numskull seminar Vaporised letters in the eye of the hurricane Fortifications have kept us at bay for a while Watch us come again, pacing my hunger pains Hungry for morsels and scraps from the frostbitten porcelain Pans in your banquets, lay abandoned Like ghost town, scratched from the map Face back to the sandpit, bandaging language Band stand blues bamboozle the bag full of madness I smoke like quote in a tangled approach To untangle the heart that you broke with a sledgehammer Blow to the back of my cranium Pacing this cage, move, break through Rust riddled bars just to claim what they gave you Analogue stars combust like lust, fuck life Gunfights tie ropes over slave rooves Thats what it came to, dream like conclaves Commandeer cotdeath, wishes on your housing Moss seeps sparkling sediments are weaving Their black widow messages, a landlover effigy Gripped by the silhouette, sick of these dress letter Text riddled heaven sent death bitten elements Death beds drench in the stench of the simmer head Guts get spilled for a breath of some fresher air Without a hope in the widest of worlds The human fly climbs heights higher than skylines Higher than sky rockets, made the bricks and stones To build this home home tight tied to a kite line Better luck next time, better start running now Or never like rats in a drainpipe scuttling Four days left till the planes fly, better get pitchforks Better get tunnelling Under the scum, a magnified evil Lurks in the patterns that the parasites see through Seethrough savages, polythene bags full of whitewash passages Wipeout land We saw the sandbags dashed at the landmarks White waves laughed laughed as the town went underneath A hundred leagues, worldwide washout Blue planet flattened the notes of the chorus The dirtiest stop out, runt of the litter wide marks in the galaxies graveyard opening Truly the last days, wild west ways Tin can tustles lead to life raft shootouts Venture a carcrash, marred by the barnacles Parked on the tarmac, last of the life form park Breathing out a dead note, singing all the lead boat Ditties to the floating corpses Stumble, so meet your creator Mr eraser Shes a brainwash away the remains of the paper. take us Caught in a maced up major, last man laughing in a world lost waste up Man better drown rat sound of the mouse trap snapping as the ransacked landmass outback, where the town had nothing but whiteness About that, id like to thank god for the soundtrack Can you hear me? Ive been calling for such a long time And you, falling through the light Can you hear me? Ive been calling a long time Ive been calling, Ive been calling for such a long time..."

Secret machines, philistines with full magazines Another regime so pristine on your tv screen Congress convenes, they send in the marines And they stifle the screams, its the same old routine From American dreams comes a nightmarish scene And the freedom to be goes head down on the guillotine We must intervene, if we dont come between They will never come clean, and this cant be redeemed"

Who are you now? Is anyone really gone? In all the world In all this space The race is run I have always dreamed that somewhere in your heart Theres a guiding light still shines For our lives and times we should have spent together But we passed each other by Like seasons out of time"

"It came upon the midnight clear That glorious song of old From angels bending near the earth To touch their harps of gold Peace on the earth, good will to men From heavens allgracious King. The world in solemn stillness lay To hear the angels sing! Yet with the woes of sin and strife The world has suffered long Beneath the angel strain have rolled Two thousand years of wrong And man, at war with man, hears not The love song which they bring O hush the noise, ye men of strife And hear the angels sing! Still through the cloven skies they come With peaceful wings unfurled And still their heavenly music floats Over all the weary world Above its sad and lowly plains They bend on hovering wing And ever over its Babel sounds The blessed angels sing All ye, beneath lifes crushing load Whose forms are bending low Who toil along the climbing way With painful steps and slow Look, now, for glad and golden hours Come swiftly on the wing O rest beside the weary road And hear the angels sing! For lo! the days are hastening on By prophet bards foretold When with the evercircling years Comes round the age of gold When peace shall over all the earth Its ancient splendors fling And the whole world give back the song Which now the angels sing!"

"[Verse 1 Typhoon] Woke up this morning, and I felt all alone Had some some good flings, but I left them all at home Now Im loving the city but Im living on my own Only thing in bed next to me is my phone And it can never fill the space that you left No amount of smiley faces in texts Can make up for the way you looked in that dress You know you had me hooked, I must confess All the other ones were good, but you were better than the best And if I cant have you, why should I settle for the rest? I know its been so long, I had to get it off my chest And thinking back to how we met, I swear I never wouldve guessed [Hook x2 Typhoon] If I travel around, how can I ever keep a girl? Just me and my sounds, in this weather beaten world If I dont fight this urge, how will I ever be cured? If I dont write these words, how will I ever be heard? [Verse 2 Typhoon] Some say a lonely traveler is just a lost soul I say a walk around the world is just a long stroll But a life spent without someone can really take its toll Sometimes I start to doubt that two halves can make a whole I heard the wonders of Fiji, and of tales that were magical So then I made the stories autobiographical I traveled the globe, and found a beauty that was natural But these days you can find me in the capital Cause thats how it goes, from one place to the next No matter how far away, Ill still reply to your texts Can take a regular day, and turn it into the best And then rekindle the flame, no special effects [Hook x2] [Verse 3 Typhoon] Never settle down, but I think I like where Im at Its just that people dont change, and you know thats a fact Its still gonna be a challenge, I can promise you that But Im still the same person, different spot on the map Ill fight my way to the top, man Im done being gentle And when I finally make it, just know it wasnt accidental Cause this path has many obstacles, its never something simple And Im tryna be more than just a lot of good potential The name Typhoon is one that youll know soon Ill have it all fine tuned, like it was deja vu Cause now that me and my crew are making major grooves The only thing to do is make some major moves [Hook x2]"

Whatever you are I acknowledge your shade is moving Potent and cool Maybe empty For where there were mars Now the summer hides uneasy And whatever you are Made it so Dim lights unbury you Broken words and crumbling stone Softly loom the night affliction From a blackened benediction From the thickening darkness Soundless Tyranteyed rejecting light An uneven crawl of hunger slow steps of neglected dances Unremitting flower of shadow You have called to me in slumber Stole out from your quiet collection Latched your veins about my stupor Dim lights uncover you Broken words and crumbling stone Cautious is your circulation Toxic flux of cruel intention Whatever you are I acknowledge your sight expanding And somewhere in the room you are breathing For where I was lost only you could fill my vision And whatever you are made it cold

"Did you ever think about forever? Its an obsession of mine. At times Ive been so deep that it made me cry. Could the world keep turning in the absence of time? Could I even exist if Im not yours and youre not mine? When I was 5, 39 was a very long time. I imagined myself dead and gone long before I arrived. But Im still waiting for the apex of my life. Im so glad Ive waited. So glad I proved you right. Ill wait forever if Im waiting for you. If It takes forever Ill wait here for you. All the time since I was 5 went by in the blink of an eye. Forever is ahead and never behind. If I could bottle this moment in the back of my mind, I could spend forever living in your light. Ill wait forever if Im waiting for you. If It takes forever Ill wait here for you. All we are, all we are is what were waiting for. If I could spend it with you, I only want you. I dont think I can love you more but Ive been wrong every time I said that before. I truly adore you. This love is the truth. Its the heartbeat of light, the god rhythm is the night. Youre my forever, Im glad I got to spend it with you. Ill wait forever if Im waiting for you."
"Im waiting For a shiny new life when I leave the old Im tired And its hard to go on when the world goes cold I hunger For a different place He prepares for me I wander Like a rudderless boat on a hostile sea Chorus Deep in the darkness calling me Out to a brand new day I dont want to be left in the back street Pinned down and hidden from the light of day I dont want to be sitting on the curb When I yearn to speed down a distant highway I wonder Will the world ever see what youve done for them? I travel Down the lines on a map with an urgent mission I hunger For a glorious place He prepares for me I wander Like a rudderless boat on a hostile sea 2nd Chorus Deep in the darkness calling me Out to a brand new day I dont want to exchange what You gave me For the worlds nihilistic ways I fight the fear and I cry, Lord save me! Put me back on the narrow highway! I dont want to be left on the back street Pinned down and hidden from the light of day I dont want to be sitting on the curb When I yearn to speed down a distant highway"

"Roots as tunnels Tunnels of Set, tunnels below Worms as doves Doves of peace, doves of war From the hills through the night Give a blessing to the thirteen moons From the temples around the bends Fall asleep when the nightingale croons Dreams as guides Dreams of a sun, dreams so long Starry schemes Schemes to untie the right from the wrong Borders as shadows Shadows of fools, shadows of moons Walls as mirrors Walls are built by our ignorance Let the hammer of wisdom fall Ignite the torches of our goddess Let her walk with us In the shadow of her horns Like kings in a deck of cards Two have become one Connection made in a thousand ways I split my soul to feel more"

And they will come, And they will dream, And they still live, To take this heaven and a cut of mine. Dark angel, cut the skin, Love the red delight, Kneel at the moonsign, Bless this gift for you, Cry at the moonsign and bless this gift for you. Seventeen sounds break the chains, three wheels, three worlds, A kiss goodbye, a kiss for sorrow, fly fly fly away. Dark angel, in the light of your eyes. Dark angel, in the light of the moon. Dark angel, in the light of the punishment. Dark angel, can you believe, Dark angel, in the splitting of a second your life did shine"

We have broken the time of the old wisdom Unscathed is no more the entrance of the kingdom We ride to bring the legacy of heathens Pagan might will rise as the golden arrow flies Winds of North are blowing so strong The gates are still flaming We hold the chronicle of our forefathers We praise every world which is written Come with me my brothers There is something you should know When the blood will stream on the ennemies Well grow the resistance till the last corpse So the falling of ennemies finally begins Our armies hold the powers And gods of heathens are by our side Let the rain moisten the ground And bury the blood to the sand Damp our heroes for the brave war And the burned gates of ennemies Well you did my brothers There is something we should honour Now we hold the kingdom of heathens And the pagan forces will grow We ride to bring the legacy of heathens Pagan mist will rise as the golden arrow flies

A crack in the mirror of our perfect world Painted a picture we thought we deserved Caught in this image we thought of as life The truth is unveiled... Our lives Were all lies Now we stare The truth in the eye Lost all hope Lost all strength No relief No escape A path through the forest of all our lost minds Wandering wraiths in the vacuum of time Bleeding the truth through a crack in the sky Trapped in a prison world in our own minds Our world Revolving Circling A dying star All lost. consumed by serenity The truth unveiled the true misery Deceived by an image of a perfect world Deceived by the veil All our minds wiped away by the rain Lost inside with nothing to gain Standing in line at tranquility lane Fighting the light while exhaling the pain Soothing sunset Calming silence Witness the revelation Inhale the dust from the real world

"Somewhere in time we were born, And brought blood, lust, hatred and scorn, Your sorry now you trusted me, Now I command that you get down on your knees For Hell the deceiver, Satans child, Your a believer, And were going wild. Put away all your virtues, Stop your climbing the walls, Just sign your name on the paper, Well have ourselves a ball. Was it the battle of envy, You were so mighty and brave, But your foolish compulsions, Sent you to the grave. Hell has deceived you, You were so blind, Just like all mortals, Youll loose your mind. Hell has deceived you, You were so blind, Join venoms legions, Cause were going wild."

Sorry, bud Just making sure you understood Your eyes look spacey Like Frank Underwood But with an iron grip Ive got the upper hand Look me in the eyes You missed your chance Took your rejection, but I didnt accept it Like venom in skin, its there but contested Paid you in full Im staying put this time Im killing this rap To the end of the line"

"From Home Again .............................................. When you pick a sprig of balsam pine On your hike along the mountain view You can wrap the scent in corduroy And bring the mountain home with you When you sit beside the oceans edge And dream of what might come to be Your fingers keep the taste of salt From the castles made beside the sea Im lonely at work now My hand holds my chin And my mischievous fingers remind me And cover my grin The scent takes me dreaming To wildberry pie And the wind hits my sails With the sound of your trembling sigh When we work to make a berry pie Lips can tell where we have been Out picking huckleberries wild To bring the harvest home again And on the way we sang a tune What I said is what I meant Our love is like a red, red rose It leaves a certain subtle scent Im lonely at work now My hand holds my chin And my mischievous fingers remind me and cover my grin The scent takes me dreaming Of wildberry pie And the wind hits my sails with the sound of your trembling sigh And the wind hits my sails with the sound of your trembling sigh ..............................................

We pretend to care in the stuffy air we breath all day We find ourself oppressing life thatll never know Save their aim from the ashes Too scared to lose our worthful power of blind control Wheres the right to rise with own force to built their system Save their aim from the ashes Delightful cultures thatll never grow with our apparent sens of relief Our sweat aint more than false deception and Our helping hands are full of blood and dirt Save their aim from the ashes We set the frame in the genuine rain of a lost generation Our sweat aint more than false deception and Our helping hands are full of blood and dirt Save their aim from the ashes All our norms have been stamped in innocent flesh All our past has been burying their unborn hope All our ignorance has unleashed all their misery Save their aim... from the ashes
"Little children snuggle under soft black stars And if you look into their eyes, soft black stars Deliver them from the book and the letter and the word And let them read the silence bathed in soft black stars Let them trace the raindrops under soft black stars Let them follow whispers and scare away the night Let them kiss the featherbreath of soft black stars And let them ride their horses licked by the wind and the snow And tiptoe into twilight where we all one day will go Caressed with tenderness and with no fear at all Their faces shining river gold brushed by soft black stars And angels wings shall soothe their cares And all the birds shall sing at dawn Blessed and wet with joy You and I will meet one day Under the night sky lit by soft black stars"

"The earth is large Large enough that you think you can hide from anything From fate, from God, from pain As long as you get far enough away So you run run to the edge of the earth Where all is safe again and just for a moment You think you managed to escape You could never be more wrong Sometimes when I look in the mirror Im not sure its me looking back from the other side What if the nightmares give chase? And they track me down even after the break of day We think we are We are agents of our own destiny In charge of when we rise or fall Capable of determining our own fate Couldnt be, no we couldnt be more wrong Cause you dont choose your destiny Your destiny it chooses you You cannot escape your fate Sometimes when I look in the mirror Im not sure its me looking back from the other side What if the nightmares give chase? And they track me down even after the break of day First you show me You show me that I cannot be harmed By any weapon or blade they try to use on me Then you cut me You cut me deeper than Than any You cut me deeper than any sword could have done Sometimes when I look in the mirror Im not sure its me looking back from the other side What if the nightmares give chase? And they track me down even after the break of day I turn deep into my soul to find the strength to stand against my fears Theres nothing imprisoned in the looking glass I learnt to understand the silver only echoes what I think into it Dont need to wait for the break of day"
While were wandering on this Earth Unaware of past fears and past regrets A labyrinth of visions is unveiled before us As portals disrupt this timespace continuum Relive... ...Atrocities for eternity Echoes of humanitys dreadful acts and times Ghosts of past wars haunt our daydreams As portals are one by one open wide We travel into our deepest horrors Leaving no trace or trail behind Relive... ...Atrocities for eternity Echoes of humanitys dreadful acts and times Realm of the lost souls Seeds of hate Immortality in the garden of lost souls An inaccessible path back to daylight Lost in a cosmic kingdom of chaos Where oblivion is the solstice of illusion Realm of the lost souls Seeds of hate Relive... ...Atrocities for eternity Echoes of humanitys dreadful acts and times Inaccessible...no return to reality!

"Strapped to the chopping block, my victims gains consciousness. She screams in terror as the pendulum swings above her, Five feet across and fifteen feet high, a contraption forged with meticulous perfection. Swaying back and forth in metronomic momentum, Taunting the victim, steel shimmers under halogen lighting. Hypnotized by the blade in motion, I commence the torture. Convulsing rapidly, she struggles to escape her shackles to no prevail. Tears stream from the ducts of her vacant wide eyes. Epinephrine hits my bloodstream thee high of taking a human life is euphoric. An increase of dopamine and serotonin creates complete ecstasy. The blade slices through layers of skin and flesh. It continues to excoriate the wound until I lower it farther. Her voice cracks as she frantically pleads for her life. The pendulum rips through her intestines and spine, Slowly slicing the human in two. The lower extremities and pelvis are Detached from the rest of the body. Blood drains from the segmented torso. The body twitches postmortally in a pool of blood and entrails."

We need to wake and find our shelves intact Our children slumbering in their quilts We need dreams the shape of lakes With mornings in them thick as fish Shade us while we cast and hook But nothing else, nothing else"

"You gave it all, all your fucking life. In your conscious acceptance of despair. You surrendered. You gave over, as a selftraitor, the few bits. The few parts that made me gain respect for you. Isnt it hard now, to crawl? In your own mess, smell the stench of your own disgust. Every living day, a battle, to embrace yourself. In the depths of your hostile frame, you are offering no resistance. Was it worth the betrayal of your only few strong beliefs? Your better times will never come theyve never been. You gave in all, all your fucking life in your conscious acceptance of despair. You surrendered."

An army charges upon the land To the sound of retreat This is bigger than us A stronger wind is blowing Blowing from Paradise Into the world to come Progress is its name Death nods his head First the dead Then the living Call their names Like a legion Their steps are retreating Out of the earth and the sea Back to the beginning of time An endless beach Where a table has been set for one With salt and water Lay down the kid And turn around and leave First the dead Then the living Call their names Like a legion
"Golden rooms where fantasies come true flowing wine And women stand in line waiting for you to make up your mind The succubus will bleed you dry this is the ending of your feeble life Within those chamber walls yield fantasies and lust Cravings beset on those enchanted Expose your weakness and they will grind your bones to dust Witness the gatherings in the chambers of madness With intoxicating beauty, they hunt at night to find their prey They prowl like wolves in the pale moonlight A scent of seduction makes them so divine Drawing you closer with blinded sight And your instincts overcome Nothing is left but for you to succumb One by one they lead them into darkness where a chamber waits inside Tempting you with fantasies and filling them with lies Just one taste and then you will begin to close your eyes Within those chamber walls yield fantasies and lust Cravings beset on those enchanted Expose your weakness and they will grind you bones to dust Witness the gatherings in the chambers of madness At first glance this seems to be a dream come true Pleasures of the flesh that mere man cannot fathom Unveiling tragedy now torture will ensue Behold the gatherings in the chambers of madness In an instant your pleasure turns into your worst nightmare Darkness, torture, and despair Your stomach turns filling you with fear You can close your eyes but youll still feel the pain You break your wrists trying to escape from your restraints Witness the removal of your limbs This must be the punishment for all your sins There is no escape from this wretched place Youve surrendered your fate to the lust of the flesh They will eat until nothing is left Still alive to see the meat on the bone Ripped and torn for a feast by the throne Of the god who lives for immorality Now is the time for the king to consume all of your remains The sight of someone eating you will drive you insane One final snap will be the end of all your pain Within those chamber walls yield fantasies and lust Cravings beset on those enchanted Expose your weakness and they will grind you bones to dust Witness the gatherings in the chambers of madness This brutal end should come as no surprise Vision fading into your own demise If you find yourself within these chamber walls Prepare for the worst, the madness will befall Hidden by their pleasure, the kind shall have you all"
"Ice cold bastards are destroying our planet Earth Who made them our leaders? Who brought this bloody curse? The system is bent to the core Why is it the wrong we adore?

Tyrants tyrants, tyrants of the Netherworld Tyrants tyrants ignore the pain of the souls you hurt Tyrants tyrants, tyrants of the Netherworld! The scared sheep seem to be an easy sacrifice our lack of unity will sell this cosmos underprice Power of man needs to win over matter Or all our dreams will shatter!

"and theres a shadow beneath the sun and shadows in the valleys where we run the darkest corners will sing out loud to hear all of heavens sounds in the time it takes to slowly slip away we smash the silent years into a day take a chance, why dont you try to take your dreams to heavens skies and the sun sets in the hollow of your eyes I feel your shadows swim within my empty halls and your shadows remain just like the Ring the one to rule them all. roll your fate with the dice if you lose you pay lifes price and when this moment slips away you open your eyes to shades of grey and as your window closes tight your shadows swim across the night it takes a moment to close your eyes and keep them closed, oh keep them closed keep them closed till all dreams die."
"As I look out the window, at the lights in the sky It brings back the memories, and a tear to my eye I see a star that we picked, as the landmark of our love Our love would never die, as long as it was lit above In my heart theres a star named after you Its still inside me, even though that were through You were my angel, my gift from heaven above But that stars all I have left of our past love Wed lie under that star, on many a soft clear night Wed lie on the green, green grass and hold each other tight Until my actions eclipsed the sunshine of your love All my apologies, they would never be enough In my heart theres a star named after you Its still inside me, even though that were through You were my angel, my gift from heaven above But that stars all I have left, all I have left, all I have left of our past love Im sorry that I swayed Your tender love, I never should have betrayed I turned my back on you for a night with someone else Baby, baby, baby, sometimes I just want to get some In my heart theres a star named after you Its still inside me, even though that were through You were my angel, my gift from heaven above But that stars all I have left, all I have left, all I have left of our past love"

"Night by night I have voices in my head. First I thought them to be parts of nightmares, but now I know where they re from the voices are from children that have died ! Awaking in a bath of sweat, the voices are gone, I don t wannt to feel asleep again I can t endure these helpless cries ! Little humans died by war, or they simply starved. A mother holds her child, no more sign of life. Mutilated corpse, a dummy in its mouth. Hunger and pain, remember, it is just a child ! Night by night theres nothing I can do ! I have a pity on these little beings. A silent voice whispers Help me please. Night by night I still can hear them scream ! In my dreams I can see them die, the victims of the madness in the world. They never did anything wrong at all, they re just the trash of society ! Little humans died by war, or they simply starved. A mother holds her child, no more sign of life. Mutilated corpse, a dummy in its mouth. Hunger and pain, remember, it is just a child ! Awaking in a bath of sweat, the voices are gone, I don t wannt to feel asleep again I can t endure these helpless cries !"

Oh, I have called her name And they came back and dried our tears Lets break the ice of silence Let us laugh, let us dance The night has thoousands of lights And two of them shine for us again The circle of desire was never meant to break So boundless was our love And went the wrong way Where have the angels disappeared? They took our love along Left us all alone Where have the angels disappeared? Oh, I have called her name And they came back and dried our tears Look into my eyes And wrinkles in my face Whatever my have happened Live is too precious to go down in flames Where have the angels disappeared?

"And the time has come. The last monolith was standing there. We all knew it was our light. And our doom. And our fate. The gates of knowledge are wide open. We have felt its breath. Our protector. Our god. Our creator. Our destroyer. The artifact of a higher sentience. Weve learned we dont belong here. Merely a cure for its ageless illness. An illusion of life. A method of mayhem. An injection. The void eater. Well cease that growing menace. Until our own end. Were not supposed to live here. But we were made to arrive here. There was nothing and then we were there. The monolith was the key. Attached to our existence. We are the alien breed. We all know we belong to darkness. This place is going to return to serenity. With it, without us.

All my friends i cant wait to leave and i wont stand for it I wont get used to it Follow me out the door"

Still be my life and suicide. Queen of the sun and the light and endless dark. still Im lying on your grave. No longer life and no more taste, the evening wind will take me home to you.

"I was dreaming I was tied to a train track twisting in the sun Burning up hoping the trains hadnt quit rolling I was ready for it to be done But when you need a train it never comes I woke up to you wearing your winter coat Youre leaving everything here but your phone And I leaned out the window but the tracks below Were quiet, calm, and cold When you need a train it never comes When you need a train it never comes [Chorus] The union pacific is due for a visit And believe me I got a plan But the plans no good without the train And when you need a train it never comes When you need a train it never comes Standing in the kitchen with all the dirty dishes You left a lot of things here undone The washers leaking and the porch lights broken Things you said youd get around to I could use a distraction and the noise of the engine Its rumblin would at least be a break From these thoughts screaming and your voice haunting The only thing louder is trains The only thing louder is trains The union pacific is due for a visit And believe me I got a plan But the plans no good without the train And when you need a train it never comes When you need a train it never comes Crying in the sweater you gave me in this weather What am I supposed to do? You cant leave me with your things as some sort of trade Cause youre wanting something new Its mean and its cruel The union pacific is due for a visit And believe me I got a plan But the plans no good without the train And when you need a train it never comes When you need a train it never comes"
"Loosened tongues we cut them out. We curse your flesh for dark thoughts. We spite your names forgotten loss. Well cut you from within. Damaged pride will resurface inside your broken spirit. We hunt you down and take whats yours. Well escape your hate. Carve out our destiny, well take back what is ours. Respawn from within, we bow before no man. You will not survive this fight. Well burn down your homes And scatter the ashes on our lost ones graves. This struggle follows me through life. Your victims we will avenge tonight. Their faces will haunt me. Damaged eyes they see no more. You cant see the threat around you. Falling around in the darkness you pray for safety. Fists shower down and boots kick in. They stamp on your fucking pride. Broken ribs and bruised egos. You cannot run, you cannot hide. You will fall. You will fall down."
"[Intro] My life has been like One long journey filled with a lot of ups And definitely a lot of downs Check it [Verse] I dedicate this verse here To my grandfather who passed away earlier this year At his funeral, I ran threw a box full of tissues My tears are dry, but I still miss you And I promise I will never forget you These last six bars just made it official Yeah, I know he can hear me Even though he dont speak English, he can understand clearly What his grandson is trying to express Its tough but Im trying my best I remember as a kid just running with him Every year I spend a whole summer with him Visited him in the projects And he knew I was intrigued by them shiny objects Cutting a Rolex out of magazine ads Tell me when I grow up I could buy one for my dad So much energy, like me quite clever These are memories I will treasure forever Every now and then I still shed a tear Walking through Chinatown I feel his spirit in the air For your legacy I go harder Tell my kids your great grandfather was a great grandfather But let me walk you to this timeline Take you back to my pops and moms grind They both immigrated to this country as teenagers You know tropical American dream chasers Immigrating blew up like disco As we moving to New York then to Frisco My pops said NY lets go This was in the 70s when he used to rock a fro Bell bottoms, pimp hat with the tilted brim I seen the pictures and I still dont think its him Fast forward, 82 that was when he met my moms Got married and had a baby too That baby who? That babys me Jin AuYeung My moms was wild young Only eighteen a senior in high school When I was eighteen, that was my school Im in charge of her life I put that in every single bar that I write Picture a young couple trying to get on track What are the options a restaurant or laundry mat? So they chose plan A So I was at the restaurant every damn day But I was only twelve, I justed wanted to play When my friends would come, I gave the food away I know it that bad for business So I apologize now if it still makes a difference I guess deep down I just hated the fact I felt trapped And that was my way of getting you back I cant go back in time and I hate it But I cant tell you that your hard work was appreciated See to the customer that just a plate of rice But to my family that shit can save a life Its more then Chinese food Its a life story of a Chinese dude And I aint come here to tell you what to eat It just food for thought over a beat"

"I smoked up at fourteen with romantic notions Of poets across the Atlantic Ocean doped up on morphine I was hoping the stuff would be an infinite source of dreams I wanted to see if it was a portal to the immortal stream Or just a weed so I sowed the seeds Hoping there was more to see, and with more attempts To score a glimpse into the vortex of hemps Female sex organs, I was just more convinced Of the transformative potential of my distorted senses With the doors of perception open everything gets more intense Every chore is an adventure and trip to the store a quest To explore foreign destinations, or a test Of orientation, if you forget your address My objective was to lower stress But the side effects were quite the opposite With blood clots in my eye sockets My optical field was myopic Short sighted, I would often fly off topic Preoccupied by the microscopic I entirely lost sight of my higher project Plus I was exhausted time for a diagnostic From Betty Ford I guess I was ready for it Before I knew it I was twentyfour And I couldnt think of any reason to do it any more Dr. Greenthumb, whyd you stop my dreams comin? Numbin me slow, leavin my mind stream stumblin Drainin me dry of my deep need to be somethin Put my feet up and Im a slave to weed burnin Curled up in a fetal position, a baby on beanbag Evil visions flutter round me as I lean back Seein spiders creeping in the shadows on the ceiling Insects steal inside my neckline, I can feel em Even my friends are mocking me, I can hear it In their vocal tones, social misfit losing hope alone I need a cup of tea, and a blanket to cover me Feelin uppity cant catch the subtleties But for some reason I wrap up another reefer and suddenly My head is muddled utterly Fuckin freak My friends are muttering now my words are tumblin out All wrong, mouth closing and opening Where is this rhyme supposed to be goin? Whats wrong with Rowan? Dr. Greenthumb, whyd you stop my dreams comin? Numbin me slow, leavin my mind stream stumblin Drainin me dry of my deep need to be somethin Put my feet up and Im a slave to weed burnin"

"Look past the deception, what do you see? The lies that theyre weaving will leave us with nothing Dont believe your eyes, the life that we lead is a fake Nothing can save you now from this godforsaken place At the edge of forever forsaken and alone the truth is upon us Were blinded by this deception with a false sense of hope, believing that were free The truth is upon us our world is coming undone Rise up from your knees Reject this life and the bullshit were being fed We stand alone and defiant Headlines were built to misdirect Open your mind believe in more The seeds of deceit have been planted throughout this world Steadily they grow and they strangle all that we trust and that we value Their vines pierce the flesh and restrict our lives Were blinded by the illusion of choice We need clarity to break free from these chains Theres nothing for the past our legacys undone the truth is upon us What if we become the future? The future of our legacy undone the truth is upon us What have we become? It makes no difference what choice we make in this godforsaken place The lies twist and block our view, when their goals are all the same Were split and forced apart, when we should be standing, side by side, to reject these forcefed lies This life is a fake This life is a fake"

"Theres a cold in his eyes as hes waiting to fall When the hope fora new world is gone He stands on the edge, his vision is clear But has he the courage for one last step? Now the time has come for one more decision Will it be wrong or right? The end of the tunnel will show you the light But also a path far away from paradise Follow the stars and dont look back Have always been said through hard times Always sunshine will come after rain But sometimes the comfort in words have to end! Riches and gold, for what you have sold Falling towards the end, not so cold No more your prime fills the chalice of time More than one way to go, more than one way to find How the story of your fate will end... Taking the strongest belief in your deeds Knowing that down this will lead Feeling no pleasure in selling your soul Hardly the finest of ways to reach your goals For the woman he cared so much for he could die But not even the Devil can find such control To deceive a heart, to deceive a life So for nothing you traded your soul Follow the stars and dont look back Have always been said through hard times Always sunshine will come after rain But sometimes the comfort in words have to end! Riches and gold... Turning his head to the sky in need for help Save my soul from fire! Turning away, stares the beast in the eye You have no power, my soul belongs to the sky..."

Leave? No I cant Self prophecy fulfilled, the art mastered V.I.P. meet and greet, in comes the pack The posters and tshirts fill up the metal racks Music pimp sample royalties fund the mack From windows to mac there is no turning back Off topic, almost lost it, now Im back on track Its showtime, the lights fade to pitch black I step on stage and hope my mic is intact The crowd cheers, sidetracked, I try to relax [HOOK] SiSidetracked Sidetracked SiSidetracked Sidetracked [VERSE] This is it The backstage coordinator gives me the que I stand, peek out the curtains to a breathtaking view Album of the year goes to Classified Flow Head over to the podium and say hello Lost for words, but I gather all my thoughts together Give thanks to my parents fans and supporters Producers and managers, and then I proceed to the floor Award show is over but the night has just begun First Grammy in my hands, I walk over to my son Kiss on the forehead, put him down and tell him run To mommy and she saw me, off her chair she sprung Celebrity family but the fame wouldnt change us Through the red flames of the carpet we blushed Black suits and dresses filled the room to the top Longest walk of my life and then it all Stopped Wishful thinking, day dreaming, empty satisfaction Procrastinating, work delaying, voluntary actions Wake up to reality, unchanged passion Missing piece of the pie, slave till I die, cant let that happen [HOOK] SiSidetracked Sidetracked SiSidetracked Sidetracked"
"Heres a vision Imagine a whole globe made with precision Continents of brown soil with green grass That compliments deep seas and trees with multicolored leaves Mountain ranges that survive through the ages Plus show expressions of time on rock faces Now gaze up towards the glorious sky Only appreciated by a powerful eye As I understand, man is to cherish the land As we coexist hand in hand But as time has past Man has created a vast Mass of trash that has the capability to smash Your natural desire to explore your state of being and Discover you fire For instance when a child is born It posseses no intelligence of hate or scorn But as it learns of hard ways It becomes tuned from its original nature As we destroy nature in the name of cash All justified by laws made by the legislature You never say rekcufrehtom cause that claim they aims to Seek justice but aint it a shame That that isnt the case yo we all are so tame That were all fair game Thats why they got our name Address social security number Even though where you bought your last rest Or mattress have you saying Oh thats just the way things are Then I explain that youre so far from your core You need to explore I wake up in the morning in war and saw And go look for more Weapons being prepared for nuclear war And then when I found some no this is to god, hit The ground son With strong winds to make the clouds run Step up in the laboratory Keep it mandatory Their response Inflammatory Now their domes all puffed up Cause they kcuffed up Give me the data chips Ill reverse gravity So mad theyll flip Show these kcuffers the light The adequate side of the scene, natty dips Mankind should feel the effects As he rips through the environment Mash up the Earths power as if It were required The whole things blowin a cold heart Stand as he asks where the fire went Trapped in an Ice age and while youre defrostin I kick open the door and let some Holocaust in Then I remain sober in the galaxy Take the form of the sun So I can shine emphatically Then I shed light on the tragedy Step aside just to make way for remorse and apathy Then I perform something you can all see As I change the climate from cold to balmy As temperatures rise I squeeze acid water out of the skies To burn out your eyes Cause you could never see what I devise And get your five lives and nine tries But usually nobody survives cause I Elevated far above and beyond So you could be bombed, crushed to dust You can be harmed You can be armed with shanks and tanks Bayonettes, Missile Threats Yet I still launch lyrical text That gets so intense It could disassemble all of those other meds So you should fear what the god invents Since I was sent under the name of Lif Which means to upLif Its my never ending duty to attempt to shift your mind From one train of thought to a more positive state So then in turn you can create Control your own fate Rather than having those with wealth dominate and complicate Living to the point where were all imprisoned People we should all pick our minds Itss Time! Look at how the world is designed Its major We should all walk out of our manger And start to educate the nearest stranger Ignorance has no remainder I manifest, prophesize visions of danger With seven lines I show you seven signs Times of the essence Choose before you lose your physical presence Perpetuate wickedness or walk along the path of god The force from which we were all created Stand amongst prosperity Or fall devestated Another victim of hatred In a land where nothing is sacred Except for these thoughts that I share With no fear to make you all aware of the nightmare I see you puttin in a little work but were not quite there Climb out of your darkness, the light is quite clear Were still to concerned with jewels and hype gear But Imma drop my thoughts until you open your eyes...Arise It doesnt matter what your color creed race or size...Arise"

Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes In the upper downtown, wherever it was The people around you, the things around you Cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book God called you a prophet When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out And it commands attention, it commands change Im talking about the power, thats inside of you And in the midst when youre, starting to understand That I caught the wrong message, and now its time Im hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God He said, Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you Its time to stop the killing I said its time to stop the stealing Its time to stop disrespecting our women Its time for us to come home and raise our children Its time for us, to really mould our communities Its time for us, not to get hooked up in religion But to get hooked up in relationship, with God And the amazing thing about it Is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess And you can tell God Im sorry I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasnt right And now that Im getting it right, Im asking you to forgive me And I may have done the things, that they said I did But Im not, who they say I am I am who you made me to be And Im changing in that, and it takes a few moments But every time I fall down, Ill get right back up And every time I make a wrong turn, Ill get myself back in line Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this! You cant resist the change And youre not condemned by your yesterday If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny Move, change, and be, now!

"More than just a pretty face You wouldnt know it from looking at her, but Jhene Aiko has been relatively invisible throughout her musical career. At age 14, she got her start contributing backing vocals to the RB group B2K. In the past few years, shes become a highcaliber muse, singing hooks for Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, Big Sean, J. Cole and Wale. Now shes ready to break out on her own. On EP Sail Out, released last November, Gambino and Lamar sing for her, and she toured with Drake on his 2013 Would You Like a Tour? Aiko pairs with Drake on his From Time and her current single, The Worst, is No. 16 on USA TODAYs urban airplay chart Finally at the wheel After years of working on other peoples music, shes eager to call the shots. When I was younger, I was just the singer and Id get songs sent to me and I had no connection with them. Then Id do the music videos and I couldnt pick my own clothes. I wouldnt feel proud because it wasnt my vision, says Aiko, 25. Now that Im doing everything I want, its so much more satisfying. Patience is a virtue Standing in the wings for the last decade doesnt bother Aiko, who is of Japanese, AfricanAmerican and Native American descent. Early on, Epic label executives tried to mold her into a pop star, but she insisted on writing her own music, and by 16, she walked away. Shes the youngest of five and has three halfsiblings, so shes used to waiting for her turn. Ive always been the little sister. Thats pretty much what its like with the people I work with, says the singer, whose full name is Jhen Aiko Efuru Chilombo. They respect me as an artist. They see me as one of the guys. Tiny, but tough When it comes to her craft, shes a giant control freak. I like to be involved in everything. Sometimes its frustrating to get my vision across, she says. Instead of explaining it, writing it down, sometimes its easier for me to vocalproduce myself. Its harder but more rewarding, because at the end of the day, I can sit back and know that all that work is real. She also does her own rapping under the name J. Hennessy Hard work comes easy Shes used to it. When I was 18, I had two jobs. During the day, I worked at my uncles law office as a receptionist, then Id take the bus to the mall to work a second job, says the Los Angeles native. Then, a few years after I had my daughter Namiko, now 5, I worked at a vegan restaurant. I thought thered be these nice people all about peace and love, but they werent. Most of the clientele were picky and demanding. Being a single working mother? Not so easy With her fulllength album, Souled Out, expected this summer, Aikos schedule will just become more demanding. Ive got a spot on Conan and Im playing Coachella in April, and, hopefully, Ill play a few dates on Drakes European tour, she says. My schedule can get crazy, but I have a very supportive family. My oldest sister really keeps everything in order. When Im out of town, she or my mom or my daughters father ORyan Omir Browner, singer Omarions younger brother will care for her. But when Aiko is home, she keeps her worklife balance in check. I take my daughter to school every day, and if Im working at night, I try to get back to put her to bed, she says. I think if I work really hard now, I can slow down in a few years and even bring her to my shows. Dreaming of sleep For her song Bed Peace, with Childish Gambino, Aiko found inspiration in John Lennon and Yoko Ono. I loved them as a couple. They photographed themselves in bed together, they did everything together, she says. Everyone knows who The Beatles are, but I dont think younger people know John and Yokos message of world peace. Thats what this song is about. Bed Peace is also about being in bed. I would love to spend all day in bed, she says. Im like a cat. I can sleep whenever, wherever."
I wont take all these lies Wont you ever realise The truth Im after is very clear Will you leave me after all these years I wont be afraid no more I want you to get out of that door Ill pick myself up off the floor Ive been gone for so long Never know what goes on Searching for just what to do So much better without you I wont be afraid no more I want you to get out of that door Ill pick myself up off the floor I wont be afraid no more I want you to get out of that door I wont be afraid no more Keep on watching Im in heaven

"When the fire starts to burn you up inside I will be there to ease your pain When the full moon casts its shadows from the sky Tormented souls cry out my name When the voices in your head lure with their lies I will comfort you safely into sleep For I will bless the weak And darkness builds upon me Slaves of the eternal silence Will forever be released When the hammer falls and crushes all the light In a world where violence sells When the cold wind blows and freezes up the night Places left where evil dwells When your darkest fears are everything you have You try to hide but youre in too deep For I will bless the weak And darkness builds upon me Slaves of the eternal silence Will forever be released We have built a monolith empire Sins of the fathers will become those of the sons Without a trace, within out ways to be done For ourselves Walls in our minds, morbid and black Until the bitter end they hold us back Seeds of the pure that we once were Spilled like the blood of those who care"
"Memories of torment strikes me. Attemps were made to suffocate me at birth. Fools, I was already ancient. Thou can not kill what breeds within Thee. Alas, this agony, the emptiness of earthborn pride hath stirred my faithful heart which guided me to darker paths. Far away from their pestilent ways cleansed was I from deceitful grace. Yet, put to scorn was I by those unclean. Enslaved by ignorance they blindly spat upon the deity of hate. Awake is the darkest fiend. By the fallen one I shall arise. Upon bewildered masses, to whom the indulgence of my soul portray as sin made god, I shall revile and quell the source whence mockery of my kind derive. This I know Facile shalt my quest not come to pass. Deathwish be my gift to all at last. Honour. Commended no longer as virtue. Yet, shalt be extolled by lights demise. By the fallen one I shall arise. Arise. Believer, speak not to me of justice, for none have I ever seen. By God, I shall give as I receive. Betrayer, speak not to me at all. You and this world ripped my fucking heart out. Again... again... and again... Again... and again..."
"Cracking the whip, horses running fast The hard groaning wheels, the deep ruts they cast The coach is rushing through the haze of the night Darkness everywhere and no White Masque in sight Hard pounding hooves, the muds flying high Deep panting breath, throats running dry The sharp biting chill is freezing their breath But the tottering coach is beating its path Invincible blaze White masked face Depriving the scourge Dreadful mirage Blazing the wrath with the union of the White Masque The lords and marquises, theyre just running scared Mysterious force, phantoms of the dark night Hunting the evil that hides in its lair A dark and caped silhouettes in the haze A covered phenomenon with a mask on his face Pistol and sword, the coach has to stop The marquis knows well, that hell lose what hes got Invincible blaze White masked face Depriving the scourge Dreadful mirage Blazing the wrath with the union of the White Masque The lords and marquises, theyre just running scared Mysterious force, phantoms of the dark night Hunting the evil that hides in its lair"

I dont trust anything that you finna say I got bills. No attention Im finna pay You really think i believe what the pastor say? After he said I got demons inside me HUH???

Numbers dont. Zero cash Truth is that Im broke. My last Truth turned to a false. My last Hope turned to hoax Somebody tell me why Im dying... For someone to confide in... Who wont tell me no lies and... Stick right by my side when... Things aint great....things aint good... Season change then...things aint great...things aint good... But they still there and they real Honest and loyal still. Too good to be true huh!

"Q When they told you your album went to No. 1, were you surprised, or did you think, Well, obviously? A I wasnt surprised. I expected it to do even better than it did. Youve got to believe in yourself more than anything, but no, I expected it. It could have done better Q You seem like youre hard on yourself A I am. Its part of being a genius, you know what I mean? You take your time with everything, and you evaluate everything. I havet rapped since I recorded my last song. I havent rapped in months. It takes time to put your life in your music. I got to gather my my thoughts back up and get back into that drive again. Even my songs that party still got my real life in it Q You put a lot of your real life in your songs, which must be painful sometimes, to make them and to perform them every night A Its not hard. Im not that person anymore. Everything you hear on my records is not me at all anymore. Im the complete opposite Q How long did the album take you to make? A Two years to make it, but it was worth it. Im getting hella good reviews from it. Even the bad reviews are calling it a good album. Nobodys calling it wack, and thats a success, but mainly everybody praised it and called it an amazing piece of work Q I never saw a bad review of it A Youre not me, so youre not searching. Im searching everywhere, from the small dude on YouTube to the person on Twitter that has 35 followers. I want everyones opinion. I like when people dislike my music. It lets me know how big I am as an artist. It lets me know my music is traveling. ... It makes me feel good to hear someone say, I like Kendrick more than Q. It lets me know how far we came, and how big we are as a company Q As youre making your album, Kendricks album comes out and does well. What does that do to you? It puts the pressure on, right? A Some people call it pressure, but it wasnt no real pressure. I know what I was gonna do. I was gonna sell regardless of Kendrick. We have different fans. Some people think Im riding Kendricks wave, but in order to ride Kendricks wave, Id have to have him on three songs on my album, using the same producers, doing the same kind of thing, but were two completely, completely different artists. I did it my way. People could say Kendrick helped me. Yes, he did help me in the sense of putting me into the light, but he didnt help me become a star. I did that myself. ... Im more outspoken, hes more observant. I say things when I shouldnt say them, he says the right things. Were two different people Q Youve talked about feeling more comfortable on this album. What changed? A Just me as a person. Im just more comfortable being me. Im not scared to be me. I love the honesty in my music. I dont think any rapper to this day puts as much honesty in their music as I do. I feel like everybody talks about stuff people already know. They talk about the government, about how people are homeless outside the White House, but we all know these things. What about your life? I like to talk about my life, my story, the stuff I see. Q A lot of the reviews point out that you talk about your life in an unvarnished way, and they cant understand why theres no apology, no moral to it. That sort of rap has fallen out of favor A You cant get an Ivy League student to review hardcore hiphop. They dont know anything about that. They cant understand the lingo. I just got into rock, but I have no place reviewing rock music. ... Thats not my life, and thats not where I come from, and I cant fully understand it. I just like what I like about it Q But Im sure a lot of your audience is middleclass white guys A They can relate to some of it, not all of it. ... Ive been to plenty of shows where I didnt fully understand the artists, but I like what I like. The same thing happens every night with me Q Do you look at it as something thats part of your job? To make them understand? A I can care less. ... It is what it is. You either get it or you dont. As long as you like it, thats whats up"
Verse 1 Your parents told you life began with the birds and the bees Growth and development started with soil and planted seeds And evolution is showing the process you are within But your parents will never tell you what happens when its the end Listen my friend Thats probably why a lot of you live your life in a bubble Cause now it just picks on you you dont even have a rebuttal For certain things that occur in the road that you guys are traveling Cant let it knock you down just stay active show youre not staggering The point that Im tryna make is to do whatever it takes To make sure the world is in tact and help make it a better place For the kids to grow and accomplish the things that they like to do Cause some ppl wont let them rise for example just watch the news [Hook Shiquon] I woke up in the the morning Sun shining and Im yawning Turn on my tv and noticed There is so much commotion Cant disregard everything That Im seeing its driving folks insane So much animosity and they are so confused Only having one reaction terrorizing others too all over the news News Reports [Verse 2 Shiquon] A lot ppl around this world freaking died Older and younger so many families cried I couldnt bare it but I never ask why Even though I wish it was different and wished that they all survived Maybe thats just the way this life works Plenty of stuff happens and make us all go bezerk Your mind is in such a shamble you think your life is a wreck Only cause you are too afraid and you dont know what to expect A girl in my state past away hit by a truck A friend of mine brother died shot and left slumped A man was hung in Mississippi a college kid had got beat but damn Some cops had killed a man and it cause some mayhem in Maryland Its overwhelming it seems nobody wants peace Cause these kids and adults are tarnishing everything in the streets Showing miscellaneous actions now everythings incomplete But dont do the world like they did Eric Garner just let it breathe [Hook] [Bridge Shiquon] They tell me when it rains it pours This life is fill with angels waiting for their chance to sore And the fire in the core will one day become as cold As the world that we live in itll never damage our soul They tell me when it rains it pours This life is fill with angels waiting for their chance to sore And the wind in the air represents the breath of our life But the world is so polluted mistaking their wrongs for rights [JaVonte] This cant be life

"Out of the forests Coming down from mountains tall Over traces of the past Through ancient graveyards vast That land, straight ahead Still dipped in shades of blue and red Is crowned with silhouettes Of a thousand armoured men Stained are the heavens Bloodred from the rising sun Our shadows reaching long and far To where the menace stands We wont hide, we wont run We stand together, proud and strong The ghostly silence bursts like glass As they come Axe, sword and hammer Crush armour, bone and flesh Dont hesitate to strike Take the enemys life Strike and slice and shatter Force your way through man and shield Charge and break their will Clear the way and kill Hear my call Make them fall Rush into battle Slay them one by one My hands are drenched with the rain of this carnage The trembling stopped with the third man I have slain No rest for us, here they come again Call to arms! Bring them down!!"

I hope you doubt your pledge When using guns to hide behind This war cant be right Pray the sun will never rise To all the prisoners of war There are facts you can never ignore Question the reasons, I implore Cause were all prisoners of war You realize your hands are tied Awakening all your fears Even though you win the war Youll lose so much more So ask yourself what this is for Did you destroy or restore? This war cant be right Pray the sun will never rise To all the prisoners of war There are facts you can never ignore Question the reasons, I implore Cause were all prisoners of war The nights were never silent The air filled with screams of despair My mind embroiled in violence I can never be repaired To all the prisoners of war There are facts you can never ignore Question the reasons, I implore Cause were all prisoners of war To all the prisoners of war There are facts you cant ignore Question the reasons, I implore Cause were all prisoners of war"
"verse 1 This beat takes me back to the days when i was a teenager Sellin weed to the strangers at the bus station Never really was patient Lookin sideways westsiders Fuck minimum wage cuz crime pays In the ze And in a major way e40 had my mind goin Thats a rhyme omen Let me try flowin Open for the crowd, look around Is it worth it? My homies steady illen and Im always puttin work in Either death or jail is certain So im buildin until the curtain closes on me Believe that Im anomalous Could fight a trojan army Steady listening to Hiero Started on my high road Elevate my mind To the highs from the lows Just another episode Smokin blunt after blunt I must have stunted my growth Cuz i was ready to erupt And everybody was corrupt But it aint always what it seems Another couple years And well be reigning supreme hook repeat 4x. When the halos fly and the rain coats dry I feel like i could be a king westsiders Repeat 4x verse 2 I brainstorm these waveforms Its like the .waves form a stom in my brain Feel the pain Now my food is organic My muse is organic My roots all planted In the truths of the planets And motherfuckers cant stand it Cuz Im clever with the words And better with the work Brother set me to the side Said were movin off of bird ave cool, where to? He said the burbs It sounded so absurd, man he couldnt have But he did and then it worked out A year later i was down south In 619 San Diego Just movin hella fuego Sharpened up my pen game With my homie from Encanto Fucked around recorded in some studio centers Where the walls filled with plaques Remember, turn around and look back Cuz it aint always what it seems Another couple years And well be reigning supreme hook repeat 4x. When the halos fly and the rain coats dry I feel like i could be a king westsiders Repeat 4x verse 3 See i was finally getting weight in When my brothers home was raided Man, he got like 900 days when incarcerated Feeling heavy faded with this baby on the way The world is on my shoulders Everyday Im gettin older Had to fall back on the kushion Some padding in my pattern Slow off all the pushin Get my mind over the matter Word to that rare thang She got me on the latter Or up in the stairway Where theres nobody who wears hate See i, i had my know how But then i understood it Added in some wisdom And everything is fluent Embedded in my music A foundation for a kingdom Everything i went through Man, it liberated freedom to my soul Now Im refined Im refreshed Progressed With every step Thats momentum And this tracks my memento Cuz it aint always what it seems Well be reigning supreme hook repeat 4x. When the halos fly and the rain coats dry I feel like i could be a king westsiders"

"For eras of torpor Midgardians wandered Empty of spirit and joy Confined to live a dull existence Praise the day of change Sudden shift of fate... At last a reason to dream for To drink for all eternity The true vial of inspiration Shortest path to wisdom It was brought to the heart of Midgard What a lavish gift of gods! By the blood of Kvasir Blended with the finest honey The meat of poetry breached From void to creation We raise these wooden mugs To kill our thirst For each drop, a renewed insight Theres no easier way To achieve a greater knowledge and unveil A bunch of mysteries about this world By the blood of Kvasir Blended with the finest honey The meat of poetry breached From void to creation We raise these wooden mugs To kill our thirst For each drop, a renewed insight Theres no easier way To achieve a greater knowledge and unveil A bunch of mysteries about this world As one we hail the brewed juice Let it spread through our inner veins High the spirits lift With dozens of gulps of mead The feet start trampling each other Happily dancing a foolish dance We abstract the sense of time And drift inside this untamed flow But before it dies away Chanting remember this gift of the gods From the divine spit Kvasir was born Enlightened being He couldnt be wrong Killed by dwarves Split in three Such is the tale Mead of poetry"
Here comes the frost that freezes every year Shutter windows hang the Advent calendar What are you doing on your own with frozen ears I know were changing like the trees in Montpelier You took a job that put you on the road For days weeks in motels sleepy TV glow With static filtering through pay phones in the snow It drowns your home by Christmases love you sos all our promises come so easy They fill distances til our next meeting But youre always off the phone Long before Id prefer to be I know that we should get some money saved Ive felt the kicking growing in me every day Oh well live fat happy when you get home you will say But Id eat beans if youd just stay all our promises are so fleeting When all I really want is you close to me But you were already out the door By the time that occurred to me

"Children of sworn malice, creatures of white dust Reveled in stigmata, condemned to rust. Innumerable poisons, cyclical depravity! A swarm of rats in decadent mortality. The rats! The rats! O, cherished dirt! O, acerbic prison! Echelons corrupt. As the poison finds, the source of the pulse That flickering candle of life is forlorn. Within the madness of four walls, A vortex drains thy marrow and spine, Tis a fatal cave wherein you dwell Carve thy flesh! Carve thy flesh! Without the shroud of sainthood The guise of acceptance falsehood. This is where thy corpse is born Carve thy flesh! Carve thy flesh! My eyes are open! Smoke and dust plummeting To the very depths Of my livid Self! For millennia I have been tricked! Promises of insanity Swollen scars, gaping scars. Carve thy flesh, BECOMEASCAR! Inhale the venom, exhale the fumes, Rotten skin, open wounds."
I recall when the bright light descends Something takes possession over me I remember when the nightmares began On that cold night of December 26th I dont know what it is but I lost all control Cant you see Im condemned by the past that They close in my history I dont want to be like This no more you cant see what I mean but you Would if you saw all the sight that I have seen I cross my heart in hope to see What I saw was not a part of me Dig inside yourself and you shall feel But dig to deep and you become like me I hate to see one more get lost like I To those big eyes December Evil words are spoken makes me fear The world that now reigns over me I was strong but now weak and I fall with my tears Cant you please make the demons leave me be I dont know what it is but I lost all control Cant you see Im condemned by the past that They close in my history I dont want to be like This no more you cant see what I mean but you Would if you saw all the sight that I have seen Please dont let your eyes meet mine I have seen it all before Cause the eyes mirror the soul I hate to see one more get lost like I Those big black eyes December 26 Those big black eyes I hate to see one more get lost like I Those big black eyes December 26 Those big black eyes
Come closer and see See into the trees Find the girl If you can Come closer and see See into the dark Just follow your eyes Just follow your eyes I hear her voice Calling my name The sound is deep In the dark I hear her voice And start to run Into the trees Into the trees Into the trees Suddenly I stop But I know its too late Im lost in a forest All alone The girl was never there Its always the same Im running towards nothing Again and again and again and again

Did they see my good intentions? Did they notice when I gave myself away? Will I ever find you? Will you ever come?

"Heaven is where or when the Devil is losing everything at a Poker game, Even Vice is laughing at him...pointing fingers. And now hes walking alone in the street, completely broke homeless On the verge of collapsing to the Inevitable... Even the Angels are looking down on him with pity... Yet not a soul dares to help him, the looser, the first One to have ever been cast aside. Hes thinking about suicide. The funny thing is, unlike us, he doesnt have a choice Evil cannot die... Raindrops are weeping, and Im a storyteller I am covered with rust falling apart like an old 69 Chevy truck. I have a lot to say if youre willing to bear with the unpleasant scent of misery nostalgia. How low can it get, when you suddenly realise that what youve been listening to, for the last ten minutes or so Trough the old transistor radio behind the bar counter, was a disco version of Beethovens 9th symphony. I wanna kill myself right here now. How socially dead of me Alias Could it be the alcohol that drank me out? It feeds on your soul yknow? From the other side of the looking glass, imagine a philosophy, That is a sardonic aftermath of everything I lived so far... Solace was just a prelude of things worse to come..."

"By Gregg Allman and Daniel Toler c 1980 EMI Blackwood Music Inc So long, I hope our paths meet again some day Oh, but whos to say, whos to say, where or when? And Ill be hopin that itll be real, real soon Yeah, Ill be hopin that youll be there sharin My little cozy bedroom Weve been together down that long and lonesome road The happiness weve shared was through each other And its a doggone shame such a beautiful thing Should have to fade away Not too many people ever had what we had To throw it all away is oh, so sad. So long, so long So long. I believe our paths may cross again And I thank the Lord, thank the Lord That this time we parted friends So for this time, so long, so long, so long, so long"
"For life is nothing but a reflection of solitudes end, giving purpose to a hope and an isolated light in an abyss of ignorance For a brief moment we must fly into a dream to fall deep into our subconscious, glimpsing for a yearning soul alike For hearts that are united through the medium of sorrow will not be separated by the glory of happiness But do not mourn the search for nothing, in accepting silence it slowly becomes a part of the speech. But is silence more painful than death? I believed death to be a phenomenon of the body. Now I know it to be merely a function of the mind To study to the order of things to try to understandgrasp their innermost essence, for Im only the ignorant to my own oblivion Simple Unpretentious Elegance Of solitude Of solitude A caterpillar can only turn into a beautiful flying butterfly, when it locks itself in a cocoon of utmost solitude. Inhumanly human"

"Life can be hard like a steel cage If you dont know how to live it. You can be so frustrated, total rage. But deep inside you must learn it The way of truth You had enough of their rules When they tell you what to say or what to do. You had enough of their lies. When is this hell gonna end for me and you? Honor , respect, justice and truth Are these values long gone? Greed, hatred, warfare and lie Its now the only way to fade and die. The word of truth begins with you No matter all the odds against you The word of truth is not always easy to say But if you try, true friends Will stay with you. Life has been always hard without. You dont decide what is right Learn that happiness is inside you. Somewhere else can it be more bright The way of truth You had enough to please every one Be true to yourself, dont be afraid to dare Remember that true friends are worth Ten times someone whos pretending to care. Honor, respect, justice..."

"The Valley Once upon a time in a distant, peaceful valley there was a village In which people lived in love and friendship together No one had to complain about anything Men loved their women, and children were grown with the sweetest loving cares One day, a foreign man came on the town He was a friar. And really, a weird kind of one He didnt talk to anyone, till he reached the town square Where he called all the people, telling he had something to say Listen to me! This valley looks like Heaven, but, believe me Soon the angels will be turned into demons Im warning you! Take care of your children Take care them far from this valley until they grow Otherwise this Heaven will become Hell! People didnt believe the prophecy, they just thought the friar must be crazy And didnt listen any further, while he kept on repeating There was a curse hanging over their heads And that they should mind their children Across that night, all the children vanished No traces could be found. No clues. No children They accused the friar, and took him to the shaman Where he explained the curse had become real and told them what to do Only gnomes could bring the children back So they had to create their gnomes The only way to do that was to catch a childs dream People brought the few remaining children to the wood Where the friar put them to sleep and entered their dreams There he found the gnomes, and told them they had to come out And find the other children Gnomes followed the vanished childrens dreams And finally found them and brought them back from an evil nightmare Created by a witch who burnt to Hell, won by dreams Since that day children have been the most precious thing of the valley And gnomes always kept on guarding over their dreams The Crypt Thunders The great sound of thunder Can bring me back again Lightnings The colours of lightning Can drive our soul insane Music The spirit of music Come from a gate of world Mystery We are caught by the mystery Until the next day is born Come in this temple of fear Im trying to save your life Walk on the line made of tears cause Ill be black and white Dont be afraid, child... Just give me one more time Fire The warm of the fire Will burn the memories Stormwind We are lost in the stormwind They are really on their knees Spirits That shine in their limits Quickly fade away Monsters Fight against the monsters Before it will be too late Come in this temple of fear Im trying to save your life Walk on the line made of tears cause Ill be black and white Dont be afraid, child... Just give me one more time The Crypt of Montmartre is fading away The secret of Christ will die with our pray The poisoned tears will run through my veins Please save from the dark the Crypt of Montmartre The Crypt of Montmartre will burn with our pray And the time will sign the end of your days The legend of Devil will possess your heart Please bring out the Princess from the Crypt of Montmartre Im trying to save us Time has come But we really seem to find the way No one can save us Time has come We are really going to find this way The Crypt of Montmartre is fading away The secret of Christ will die with our pray The poisoned tears will run through my veins Please save from the dark the Crypt of Montmartre The Crypt of Montmartre will burn with our pray And the time will sign the end of your days The legend of Devil will possess your heart Please bring out the Princess from the Crypt of Montmartre The Crypt of Montmartre is fading away Come and save the Princess and the human race Please follow the traces, escape from the dark Mankind can survive in the Crypt of Montmartre"

"Stand aside as Infernos flames get higher and higher. We cannot waste a single drop to save our lives from this threat. As smoke unfolds we hope to see thin slices of heaven Cause senses never fail to believers. If only we could have knew that our guiding star was fading away. Now it seems that we blind each others with the same source of light. We need to fight radiation, the only common enemy, disenchant, realize, The clock is ticking and we are the hands. We are the hands. The weight of the world is growing over our shoulders and makes our bones crushing slowly, locking all the safe ways. Our throat is dry but all we need is driving the ship faster to a dead end. Mayday, push our vessel over the edge, taming the waves of extermination. When well taste the ocean inside of us our burning corpses will reanimate. A brilliant sun will greet our words in vain. At the end of it all well find the answers, Even deserted hearts may turn to water springs. At the end of it all well find the answers, The purpose of our journey and why it has begun."
"One by one send them shuffling down the slope. in a jumble to tied together with string or rope. In pairs or clustered like the ticks in a dead dogs ear. The deceased... the dead... they just dont care. You know the dead wont mind. They wont mind if we cut them up into tiny little bits, if we take away their children, throw them into the streets. Sells them off for science or feed them to the throng, the dead are easy with the dead you cant go wrong. Grind their bones to dust to fill in the cracks, or hang them up as warnings along the hangmans rack. Dead dogs dont bark, nor do dead dogs leave their mark. The dead are easy, with the dead you cant go wrong."

"Straight from a block I used to walk down often Many personalities now left in a coffin Form reaquainted like I found it in a drop in Had a homie there from the streets of Boston Got lost in, the life that the reapers preach Scythe blade banana clip, cut into dices Taking chances with these things he thought were so priceless Im right with him now he faded past all the clowns Went to his house and smoked out, the first time for me So high I threw up, while in my mind I through down I brought my bag and my laptop with beats on the hardrive now The bong passed in a circle, one of the dudes went to fill it Not with the same bottle my homie had that was his and I looked at his shoes I thought I knew what was next Everybody took a hit, I kept my beats at my chest I was next, my friend had told me I had to To take a hit the first time you couldnt run to the bathroom Thank god it wasnt laced, I wouldve hit all all the same And this beat you hear now wouldve been lost in the fray Why I pray Memories playback, playback, repeat I look back now and know he really does see me Believe me, I read into this stuff, back to the first time I ever took a puff He went to shake my hand as I just looked at his shoes Bandanna stray tooth skin rough with tattoos For a while were alone, me and my homie Saw why the high enticed him, he was actually kinda lonely Groaning as he said more people came than they went Passed out on the bed computer at the back of my head Awoke and found it where I lay, still have it today This is why I pray Days in grey, never seen a smile I liked More fakers than ever I found some right in a mic On a mountain doing time seeing the fields they approach A lawyer, a doctor, music is both A preacher, a politician, Ive got your vote A counselor, an engineer, I build cities of hope As you look above and skies are grey Just remember why I look at you, and why I pray"
Its three oclock in the morning And its time to go The traffics moving Just like a circus show Theres a car crash in my head And one on the road And nothing seems to go As I planned it to go So Ill just take it as it comes Cause it all just might be a joke And Ill take it as it goes It goes away with my better days In every situation Theres a moment of hope From 57th To the streets of Rome So we stand in line And we quietly wait our turn Just to see that nothing is What it seems to be So Ill just take it as it comes Cause it all just might be a joke And Ill take it as it goes It goes away with my better days So much to see But Im caught in between All that Ive got Well I cant choose between Whats fake and whats real Coax me to stop Wont you come lift us up Ill just take it as it comes Cause it all just might be a joke And Ill take it as it goes It goes away with my better days

"She saw a raven spread its wings, Without the strength to fly away How could she know that this was its cry Dont start your journey now. Canonic chant and silent lament, Candles are burning, times passing by Who will first go beyond the light Time will tell, but the choir will still sing Requiem Aeternam dona eis, Domine Ex audi, ex audi orationem meam The last thing she saw were the red flowers by the road. She smiled and said What a beautiful day... Then the angels took her away... Voca me, cum benedictis Voca me"

"Swathed in sombre velvet She left me in her repose In dusky dank tomb perfume Enwrapped in swoon Never to arouse Thus I stood in cheerless crypt And wept for her in grief My lurid beauty, mistress dead I hate this kiss of icecold lips But she slept amort in dusk So princely in her grace Imperious, monarchial I hymned this majesty of death I called to thee Wake up from this Impenetrable slumber! Yell of mine resounded The dismal castle Lapped in woods in a heavy mist Time had passed Since she succumbed And Death blackened her dress She shared her beauty With deathworms Devoted her slender waist To marble stone embrace In the realm of Morpheus For some days she seemed to rest All of those unearthly fantasies She dreamt now cobweb veils But what is the kind Of this soft voice Haunting me in the nights? Wher these entreaties Spoken silently The moan of my Funeria? All my misgivings are broke Steal me from here... I know that thou hast not gone Unseal my holy lair... When the light of moon prevails Over picturesque landscapes And the awe fills up the lands Night will bless our sweet embrace Sweeteest was the song That was heard From under the slabs Where embellished She craved for me The wine could not drawn her call Candelabra whirled In the nocturnal wicked dance Endless supplications Drove me out of my mind Flustered I rushed down the stairs Draw near, my minion... Twas time to meet her again I languish in my grave... Through the nights I summoned thee Time has come to set me free Thou art welcome to take me On our couch of ecstasy Vesper was turning into night When I found myself in cellar Lighting up my path With a cresset burning bright I came up to the shrine Where my departed Queen abided Slowly, as if in dream I smashed down the seal And broke open the crypt My love oath to redeem Stars were dim So dull as her eyes That stared right into the sky What did she reveal in far Beyond the mortals grasp? Bloodred wine made me blind Haze covered my mind I took her up To join our lusts We joined in our lusts... In abandoned castle Well give ourselves Up to our love No one will disturb our harmony Neither loons, nor servants at all We imbibed the lure Of aristocratic ardent sex Ghosts and wraiths Were guiding our dormitory And nobody ever could vex Duchess in her prime Posthumous sorceries Inflame desires of obscenity Bewitching coldness And defencelessness of thine Attached me back to thee And I could not resist thy spell And stayed with thee My nymph, forevermore Castle became desolate Now me and thou... Inhabit this bodeful place And share our fervent love... Now the light of moon prevails Over picturesque landscapes And the awe fills up the lands Blessed be our sweet embrace..."
"Never forget that a mage is not a priest All sins are granted, provided one gains experience Daily introspection, prayer and meditation Will soon lead you from passion to Holiness It is vital to know the boundaries of love in order to not mislead oneself... Concerning love, disappointments are inevitable A lover will have nothing to offer... but his own delusion Wisdom advises you to watch only from afar the entire worldly fantasy Ones partner should never go beyond their wonderful task As a second fiddle to the sexual pair It is vital to know the boundaries of love in order to not mislead oneself... Let us await our Chymical Wedding When our soul will rise and marry God for eternity Utter incontinence is not an obligation Love, and the suffering it causes reveal A long windy road to inner perfection From passion to Holiness Choose your partners wisely Because as a disciple, you are sentenced to remain defensive Offer no clarity to general cowardice Flee judgement, contempt and mockery Dont ever be compliant Let your most passionate feelings rise and become unreal Thus you will unveil almost nothing to misfortune Let us await our Chymical Wedding When our soul will rise and marry God for Eternity Utter incontinence is not an obligation Love, and the suffering it causes reveal A long windy road to inner perfection From passion to Holiness..."

I see the angels, Ill lead them to your door Theres no escape now No mercy no more No remorse cause I still remember The smile when you tore me apart You took my heart, Deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams, I wished they turn into real. You broke the promise and made me realise. It was all just a lie. Could have been forever. Now we have reached the end. This world may have failed you, It doesnt give you a reason why. You could have chosen a different path in life. The smile when you tore me apart. You took my heart, Deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams, I wished they turn into real. You broke the promise and made me realise. It was all just a lie. Could have been forever. Now we have reached the end."

Alone in the prison I made of my mind like many mornings before I stare in the ceiling until I go blind its hard to take anymore I ask from the fools how they slumber away with all the evil around but no one can answer and no one can say and theres no peace to be found A slumbering demon awakes in the night an ocean away if we are to live we will have to unite kill it with fire! Burning higher! At five in the morning Im drowning my fears it seems the right thing to do a blanket of calm in this valley of tears tomorrow rises anew A slumbering demon awakes in the night an ocean away if we are to live we will have to unite kill it with fire! Burning higher! Like cockroaches baking in sunlight of day the world is bustling along while lawyers and bankers are nibbling away we have to try to stay strong A slumbering demon awakes in the night an ocean away if we are to live we will have to unite kill it with fire! Burning higher!

"Your skull on a network broadcast. Sweaty palms holding a bloody hall pass. Show their faces so they keep on watching. If silence shows up then just talk though it. Endless echoes in a big old hallway we rot in. We report and you die. We even let you speak for us, you worthless piece fo shit. Just shut up. Shut up. Just shut the fuck up. You dont even know what youre saying. I cant think while Im staring at the screen. Our lifeless trophy, fixated and unaware. Blinded with pride, becoming the enemy. While the amputee salutes and the lynch mob ties their noose. We cant help but drown before the ship even starts to sink. I cant think while Im staring at the screen. The days turn to weeks, maybe well find a way. And Im not getting sleep. Im not fucking sleeping. Ive ground down my teeth till theyre dust. But you need me, Im telling you this. Well burn down our house together. Together. Were fucked. Every man for himself. Our currency is ignorance. And weve been doing just fine. Well keep rewarding ourselves for economic genocide. I cant think while Im staring at the screen. The days turn to weeks. Maybe well find a way."

"[Chorus PHIA] Would You Rather Have Peace? Or die fighting for freedom? Would You Steal to end Poverty? Or go broke feeding hungry Would You try be Divine? Or imbrace your inner demon When the worlds on your shoulder Your choices change the seasons [Verse 1 PHIA] Would you spend your last buck, on a bum, at a bus stop? Would you give your last meal, to an orphan, at a truck stop? Would you pick up your gun, and fight, for a revolution? And would you embrace your mind, if I taught you, how to really use it And would you just save yourself, and your family, and be selfish Or would you fight for a better cause, if I told you, it was relevant Or would you light that flame, knowing damn well, you couldnt put it out Now the house you built, burning to the ground Nothing left but ashes to be found Just to keep them from getting what you love the most, would you burn with the crib Like a captain of a ship, or would you bounce out knowing they would never know Start a whole new life, in a whole new land Cut all communication, with your family and friends Or would you try to rebuild, on a fertile foundation Amongst ?, Inwhich you held sacrid [Chorus PHIA] Would You Rather Have Peace? Or die fighting for freedom? Would You Steal to end Poverty? Or go broke feeding hungry Would You try be Divine? Or imbrace your inner demon When the worlds on your shoulder Your choices change the seasons [Verse 2 Dialek Dubai] You better stick to your gameplan, dont let one play sideline your grind You better stick to the gameplan, you gotta get yours, I gotta get mines But here, there is no gameplan, must follow the faith within your heart Lead by the light, in the mind, whenever blindfolded paths seem to crash Your course, your concious exposes, the God within your mind But what to do when the devils words, sound a little more inspiring No deliberating, where the only liberation comes from firing Rockets at they profits, like motherfucker who hiring? In a hostile situation, my righteous souls will get violent In the end of days, what seems a maze No way out but to fly away What money cant buy, bet your soul gon pay What money cant buy, ... your soul gon pay How many will grow their wings, in the incident of the broken dream Transcend to supreme beings, and change the world with simple deeds I know plenty, bet Bentley, overcome the essence of divinity Rather have my serenity, still gone die fighting for freedom Cause the worlds on my shoulder and flows are changing the seasons [Chorus PHIA] Would You Rather Have Peace? Or die fighting for freedom? Would You Steal to end Poverty? Or go broke feeding hungry Would You try be Divine? Or imbrace your inner demon When the worlds on your shoulder Your choices change the seasons"

I meet him in Wyoming at the Cheyenne rodeo Just a kid in pigtails and thirteen at the time I remember how I cheered the day he rode a horse called Midnight And I vowed that someday that cowgirl could be mine Followed him to Denver where we became good friends Wed sit around the cutes and talk while he was killin time Hed laugh and tell me stories but hed never mention stayin For the next town and the rodeo were always on his mind Hes a rodeo cowboy he follows the circuit Where top moneys paid thats where hell be found The only thing he owns is a horse and silver saddle Rodeo cowboy hell never settle down In Salt Lake City Utah he told her that he loved her But still I knew he wasnt born to be the settling kind For with tomorrows sun hed pack up his ol suitcase And leave all thoughts of me and love a hundred miles behind The last time that I saw him was in Amarillo Texas Im still in love with him although he cant be mine But Ill always keep the shinny silver buckle that he gave me Reads All Around Cowboy of 1969 Hes a rodeo cowboy he follows the circuit...

I never showed care for my son. This is the consequence for my negligence. I can only hope you use it well on the other side. But I will keep hoping you do not pass. So that it can be shared, so that your heart can be shared. I keep asking why youre still in pain If you wear the scars of my mistakes.

"In the rays of rising Sun The veil of ice is reddenIt strewed and chained by coldness And weaved on the web of dreams Hoarfrost of Blood is glimmering, sparkling, It melts, scattering by crimson ashes By the bloody scabs it clotting, Blackening, growing dim, disappearing in dust How much blood was shed upon this land, That snow became of the dawn color? Forefathers returned to heirs the Heroes Blood For they arise ... the Defenders Hordes!... Elders gave a sign to stand in ranks, to Sharpen the swords, preparing for fight For the snowstorms of gore bury the enemies, For the rivers be filled with blood of the foes! Its time for banners to sing on the wind now, Time for standarts to inhale the Freedom Its time for the Aryan Spirit to rise, To fill the veins with Hoarfrost of Blood! Let fury make hands to grasp in fists And wolfish roar shall seethe in throat Strike by strike ... our foes shall fall Step by step ... we shall cleanse the battlefield!"

"Livin The Dream My mind mutilated, Violence slowly eats it away. Now merging with reality, whats fucking happening? Im not like the rest, I have never loved anything. Dark shadows cloud my mind, vicious creativity. My eyes begin to see clearly now the mist is gone. Feeling sick to my stomach but aroused by what Ive done! Awaken to my own dark fantasy, brick bludgeoning her fucking skull. My eyes begin to see clearly now the mist is gone. Feeling sick to my stomach but aroused by what Ive done! What the fuck! Everything I thought was in my head, is right in front of me bleeding. Bodies strewn and covered in blood. Remains of the dead. I look around I was sleeping in a pit full of detached remains. I look down my cock is deep in her slit full of her fucking brains. Her brains. Fuck I love looking in their fear stricken eyes, abhorrence. I cant ignore the voices in my head, I just wish I stayed awake to hear their cries, repugnance. Once I choose you youre already dead. Am I living in my head? Im a messed up type of freak. I feel sick and twisted inside but killing is one hell of a ride. Scattered limbs around me, fermenting. Oh Fuck! I feel sick and twisted inside but killing is one hell of a ride. Splattered skin all over me, slow rotting. Ive lost it. Thousands lay wasted in my wake, viciously raped. Some are left alive to deprive, cutting off their hands and feet. Crying in pain they beg and say that they have changed. I prepare the feast of each others leaking meat. Im livin the dream, Im livin the dream."

Bells toll all over the town, burn, burn until its all gone Game over, what was a bad joke is now a reality show... We all are forced to obey... we ALL are forced to obey... I climbed up the mountain, and dug a grave for each day of pain, its in the past, this moments so frail... I am what you made me With years of abuse, So burn!!!!

"[Verse 1 Kinetik] Its funny how the truest love can always breach the heart Im pining for you and weve only spent a week apart Im staring at your photos like they were a piece of art Getting emotional but nah I need to keep it smart Missing the simple things like going for coffee or dinner And feeling proud because I know that I got me a winner And sometimes I drop the ball like a sloppy beginner Then youre in the baddest mood but I love your attitude And every morning when I wake up Im reading your texts From the night before but its more than me fiending for sex And even in a different time zone Whether youre on Skype or Facetime you leave me with my mind blown I love your dress sense and Im always left impressed I stare even when you wear some leggings and a vest And when I look at you its quite surreal Youre way above the rest and thats even when theyre wearing high heels My harshest critic and my biggest fan Its never been hard to admit it but youve made me a different man Teaching me new things as well as expanding my thoughts You put some colour in my life just like the Vans I bought So when Im sitting next to you at Sunday service Or on the bench at Queens Park where we had our first kiss Thats when Im certain it for real and Im most content Loving with hope again and now youre like my closest friend [ScratchedSung Hook Tone Richardson] There aint nothing in this world that can take your place Love, love People dont understand, they cant understand How I feel about you Thats when my heart stops One love People dont understand, they cant understand How I feel about you [Verse 2 Kuroisoul] Me and you, night and day, one and the same We became each others favorite I swear the love was sacred Im amazed with the way we clicked so very quick You can tell we were joined at the very hip So many were quick to make their remarks About the fact that Im a Black and youre an Asian At times it was blatant, at times it was hidden We knew that they were talking but we could never listen They say I put you on a pedestal Some of your friends said that my intentions were only sexual A few of my friends did it discreet They figured Asian women are timid and weak When your Mom figured out we decided to stay together She cut off your bills didnt care whatsoever But you stuck with me for over two years Stood up to your parents stood up to your peers And then they forced you to move to Hong Kong A love story gone wrong cause now you long gone Even though its not easy maybe we can get past this Sitting in my car where we shared our last kiss Thats when I knew it was for real and Im most content Missing you with hope again cause youre like my closest friend Cause youre like my closest friend I told you Id make you a song [ScratchedSung Hook]"

I feel the undertow The last thing that I saw My last glance... What was the preachers plight Where is the promised truth I see no heavens might No, my existence will fuse In my shallow grave I see the pictures of the past All the anger starts to rave My hopes have been vast"

"Here you are, O divine Star, rising beyond the horizon Thy red light shining is the sign that the time has come Spirits of skyward, ride the wind, come with me and guide This my lonely way through lands where time stands still My axe by my side, holy Skyward watch over me Dispel any fear creeping in my soul Through enchanted paths, a stone kingdom Dismal and fatal lakes May I ride beyond the forest where the heroes lie You fly, noble Spirits, in the sky Toward defeat or victory Toward legend and pride Or death guide me to my end I feel a power around this place I feel the temple is near Dark clouds spread a dreadful veil Thy blaze alone shines on Now immobile and still in the dark Through the mist and the fog Here! The mighty shape appears before my gaze Everywhere sorrow Of the divine rage I see the rerrible signs Around... around... around... around... Desolation and dim night Where is that spenour and pomp Thy eternal fame rests on? The ancient glory That rose and bloomed Is but a dimremembered story Of a past time now entombed Where is the grandeur sung by poets? You were the reign of dreams and hopes Now you are only a vast dark ruin Should I fail and die, i give you my soul Gods, take and keep it in the kingdom beyond"

Does he think that a series of mysterious, hallucinatory work is not inferior To that of gods Or other men that smother other men To arch their arm out to the sun And dent a bigger bit of damage To the collective subconscious That has swollen up with such presence And left our planet earth irrelevant just for the hell of it Seems prevalent, but I do not concur, Im saying hell with it To hell with it, to hell with it Do I really want what the selfish get? I suppose I do because here I sit Willing to record this selflessness Forget about it, forget about it I cant be silenced so let me shout it I admit it, this situation fits Its what I ask for, and grasp at Understanding that you overestimate the last laugh Ha."

"As the people of the Eastern Cape, we need to stop this inferior way of thinking that an artist has to come from a more superior province like GP for them to be given props. People like DJ Tulz, Maxhoseni, Number, Blaqphamas, Andile Seskhona, Iintloko Zeenyoka tons more have been giving us beautiful music for years and yet we fail to big them up. Instead, we idolize mediocre artists just because baphuma ejozi. Our People dont need to win awards like Zahara or Berita for us to give them recognition. The awards should be a cherry on top of the props that we, the people theyre trying to serve, have already been giving them. Having said that, big ups to Zahara, Berita, Luthando, Point 5, Dumza Maswana others whove been flying the EC flag high As for the EC government, they need to stop this hypocrisy of organizing big events, invite big stars, give them tens of thousands then only give our local artists the change.The amount of money they give to 5 national artists would be enough to give a platform to 30 local artists Im not undermining the opportunities that the government gives to our artists during The Carnival and the Switching on of Lights, however, with all due respect, they are not enough Theres absolutely no reason they cannot come up with programs that will assist boys like Celtic, Lolo, Jigga. Give them a little push the right direction and help them turn into national icons, right from our backyard.Do they really need to go to JHB, CPT DBN, get exploited before they finally make it? I say that aint right! Eastern Cape is as good as Gauteng and our stars deserve to shine, right here. King Beema trufm"

"Mass gaces, open opportunitys for our minds to replicate the pleasure of fear. Mocking the prosiness of sound, the frequency drops to subsonic standards. Phantasmal tempest prospects the rain of arrows. Sharpness defined by the solidification of man fragments and desecrates the ears of the unborn. Auditory perception infects its genesis for the genetics of superlative venom lactating spawn. A spawn of man, irreconcilable to moral of virtue. The evil of man is upon us. Resonance. The depraved separation of lie is between us. The mass graves, filled with ear ruptured versions of adoration. Resonance Supersonic beings relapse their versions of noise. Resonance Only the deaf contain sanity. Resonance. Only the reverberating aftermath of this insistent apocalypse settles in the minds of the deaf, forever."
You wont stem the tide You are powerless against The endless chain of events Nothing ever stayed the same You like to believe that Morals deteriorate Traditions lose their meanings The old values are lost You see signs of the times Ever changing with disbelief You see signs of the times Ever changing At the end of every day One has to face new dead certainties Youre cursed to adopt Or you are lost between dead certainties Nothing really is as its always been The wheel of time is ever turning But you are bound to remain In cessation While history moves forward Times waits for no slave Peter Frick Bass Sebastian Schilling Guitars Kai MllerLenz Vocals David Hbsch Guitars Martin Engels Drums

Better be sure if its legs your busting Better be sure if you take that step Because theres no looking back and its on your rep Sure, its justified, dont make it right What about the future? Use foresight Youre trying to avoid jail not go back Take the high road and know how to act It takes two, its not all his fault Even though he laid the groundwork screech to a halt Hes had it in the making for some time now Had it in head that she aint mine now Throw my smoke in the street Light another one put this on repeat"

"Hold your facade, be a good little boy As you play with the truth As is life was just a ploy Then you rape the words with madness As you kill the world with good So rosy are those lenses wich you see through... Label me, label all who disagree From behind your walls You can shoot item in their knees And still holding up your shady shield A saint you are indeed... Work the lurid tongues of your entourage... Oh, behold... How the fools said that lifes a game And goodness merely fame They close their eyes To find dull darkness in their minds Honesty makes you free So they shackle you with lies And I wont forgive them for their crimes You put words in my mouth Isnt that what youre about? Tiny mind, running numb Seeking shade from the sun You wont take a stand or understand Its time to go beyond You just hide behind your cunning camouflage... Your sick cabal... ritual bizarre Drown in caviar... you cant kill us all Youve gone too far..."

"While drinking alone in a Tavern one day My eyes they scarcely could see I heard a kind voice ringing so loud and clear And heres what the voice said to me Cho Go home, go home and kneel by your bedside and pray Go home, go home God will answer your prayers today God sobered my mind and saved my soul And erased my thoughts from all fears And back to the Tavern I preached of these words The words that still rang in my ears Cho The crowd started leaving with head bowed so low As the Bartender picked up the key As he locked the door, he wispered these words Was the same words that God spoke to me Cho"

"Sometimes we reach a dead end, sometimes we face the truth, cant spot the point, nor get the sense. These bits of time that stop by they are the fragments. these moments are your history, they make your life. When your days are dark and your nights are cold, and tomorrows like a lonely room, I guess you know the reason why? Can you please tell the difference between all and nothing, now and then, laughter and crying, since and when? When your days are dark and your nights are cold, and tomorrows like a lonely room, dont lock the door and hide the key. Let us not live someone elses life, then our own will pass us by. Youd better turn back that handful of time, oh please wont you turn back that handful of time. Turn the lights down low, its gonna take forever tonight. Cross the line to where the dreams get murdered by reality."

"The fire still burns, when you are gone. Life in the North goes on without you. My fire will burn, with you or not. My passion will overcome. Years end, coming home, and what do you have to show for yourself? I amount to nothing more, than what they understand. Feel the sense of confusion, for your wins you cannot explain. See the lack of comprehension, over the ground you worked so hard to gain. The fire still burns, when you are gone. My fire will burn, with you or not. We live for the thrill of the struggle. We live for the love of our sorrows. I fight the fight I can never win, but I fight the fight for the fight itself. And so I am rich with failure? Brutal north, bring me down again. I guess these are the risks you take, when youve been gone for so many years. Would they even look up from their tables, if suddenly you appeared? The fire still burns, when you are gone. My fire will burn, with you or not. We live for the thrill of the struggle. We live for the love of our sorrows. Brutal north bring me down. Brutal north bring me down again. I stood at the foot of the mill again, like a metaphor of northern time. I watched them burn off the excess, flames to the sky The fire still burns, when your are gone My fire will burn, with you or not So many small losses, for one giant gain Quiet victories spent alone, along the way Now I wander the streets as out of place as the day I left No better off. Nothing has changed. These are the risks we take...I guess? Brutal north bring me down. Brutal north bring me down again."
"Searching in the ruins of me, looking for answers Even though Im all alone like an terminal cancer I raise my fist into the sky And realize it was all a lie You never told me, always lying The truth was that you were dying...

ITS ALWAYS HARD TO LOSE SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVE BUT IN THE END YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FREE TO MEET THE ONES ABOVE DAMAGE IS DONE BUT NOTHING IS IN VAIN YOU WILL WALK TOGHETER AGAIN AND FORGET THE PAIN Soulstone splinters in my heart Crying for redemption My love for her is stronger Than the worlds foundation I raise my knife into the sky Everything is lost in a sigh An ocean of blood, bright light She takes my hand and helps me up..."

The lies of Christ will lose the ways of Hell I chose I drink the floating blood defy the fury of God I have turned my back on Christ to Hell I have sacrificed I have made love to the Pagan Queen the gates of Hell I have seen I heard the angels cry I watched the witches fly I saw the clouds of death Slowly blackening the sky I read the book of spell I chimed deaths ancient bell and when I die I have a place reserved in Hell In Conspiracy With Satan I ride the bloodstained goat I let the brewage float I have seen the reapers face and walked through eternal haze I have kissed my masters hand I have seen the children of the damned I heard the demons call and seen a thousand virgins fall I heard the angels cry I watched the witches fly I saw the clouds of death Slowly blackening the sky I read the book of spell I chimed deaths ancient bell and when I die I have a place reserved in Hell In Conspiracy With Satan
"The beauty of the pain of this connection comes again To remind me I am losing my telepathy Thought for thought and wordless knowing, Instantaneous and growing The deep empathic state that we once shared The bitter truth Im forced to swallow As Hamlets phantom to you I must appear The world is turning wrong way, I feel this gravity Pulling you away from me The world is turning wrong way, Now through dead eyes I see Its turning you away from me They will use a blind belief to vindicate obscenity To justify each misery that you now must endure Question everything that you see, Promise they give you so freely Will all hide a much darker truth within Now the importance of each moment Is revealed and its my torment Time will slow down but will never stop for us The world is turning wrong way, I feel this gravity Pulling you away from me The world is turning wrong way, Now through dead eyes I see Its turning you away from me I was eighteen days away I was eighteen days away From a moment that was already lost I just did not know I was eighteen days away I was eighteen days away If I could go back and change one thing Then I would be there now You were in my hands You were in my arms Arms that were not strong enough to hold on I didnt understand The consequences of The smallest choices I always believed I would have second chance The world is turning wrong way, I feel this gravity Pulling you away from me The world is turning wrong way, Now through dead eyes I see Its turning you away from me"
I have a perfect love A love that you could only dream of Perfect Love Thats what I call a Perfect Love All the visions and the colors that I see Cant compare to the love that you carry down to me Can you feel it Can you feel it Can you feel it alright Coming on stronger than anything you ever felt in your life Unconditionally ecstasy Ecstasy Feel it in your body when you feel the presence of me Baby Baby D Ride the winds of love until the end of time I got something special in my possession you need to find Honey baby sweetness whats the deal Keep the rush going on till the dawn keep it real If you thinking what Im thinking Ive been thinking of a place Where the bass never stops and we never take breaks
Lying by your side Your eyes are shining bright Whispers in my ear while Im holding you tight If you fall asleep I just try to keep Every single word youve said to me The hours passing by Words are passionately Deep inside I feel that you love me Deep inside I feel that you love me And I love And I love you too Dont say a word Its enough to see That every part of you is loving me Every part of you is loving me And I love And I love you too And I love And I love you too

Its madness, and I just cant take no more, I passed out Couldnt help but crash out, from last night, Im gassed out Slept for a minute but I didnt sleep too long before I was awakened by some heavy banging on my door It was the popo cause inside they shined they flashlights Got a funny feeling that this got something to do with last night They trying to tell me that Im wanted for kidnap and murder Telling me they got proof that I murdered my exemployer Dont think my lawyer can help me with this one, uhuh I grabbed my pistol, put the clip in and Im out the back window, Im gone Hook 4x"
I am walking Through the valley of the shadow of your name Its been another afterlifetime Since you left me here this way How about a little game of chess How about we roll the dice What can I do Where should I go now I want to look into your eyes Drifting in the state of limbo Condemned to idleness Listen to the sound of distant memories Passing through the white hourglass Just wandering around Looking for the way to my home Ive lived someone elses life Waiting for the perfect moment Ive lost all track of time What can I do Where should I go now I want to look into your eyes Listen to the sound of distant memories Passing through the white hourglass In the middle of light and darkness In the middle of bright and shade I was trying to afford your kiss I was trying to escape Now Im the soul Banished to everlasting wanderings

I want to see those city lights I want to drive though this town with the windows down And my friends screaming, Your face, your lips, your hands, your scent, and every word you never meant is everything that I have left. Is everything that I have your face, your lips, your hands, your scent, and every word you never meant? Is everything that I have left tonight? Im gonna beat it tonight.

"[Verse 1] A world, that thrives off the value of a dollar That can misconceive the value of a father It may put more value on a baller than a scholar And may discriminate on the colour of a collar The making plain offence needs to be a little taller cos an outsider might cause a layout to be altered Resolutions lay in the barrel of a revolver And taking someone elses life can be a problem solver A world thats losing the value of a human And focusing attention on the speed that its moving Not worth the time unless the clock comes cordless Download an app that can interact for us Its becoming harder for a human to survive In a manmade world designed to isolate the mind Extract all ideas and put em online Leaving you a bunch of bodies feeling like a waste of time [Hook Fabiana Palladino] No no no no no no no I aint on a licence to kill like doubleO I just wanna live life and survive it No no no no no no no I aint on a license to kill like doubleO I just wanna live life and survive it [Verse 2] Our societys developed psychologic needs With individualism bringing narcissistic deeds We get it to the public with media supplements And isolate it even more when we run from it We joke about robots taking over freedom But what if were slowly turning ourselves into them Modern technology opening horizons, closing personalities, dehumanizing New era formalities, new things to strive for Value orientated, whats a life to a cyborg?

"The ancient civilizations In their temples filled with dread Were linked together with their gods By rivers flowing red Prosperity and power Gained from bodies without heads In sacrifice the balance lies The chosen stricken down The gods insatiable lust for death Had limits never found Harmony can only exist With corpses on the ground Humans squander greatness The ways of wisdom gone A cancerous shadow looming I must bring back the dawn Selected for this, I am This world screams inside The lambs await my coming I see inside their minds One by one the open minds Are standing by my side Taken from the hand of darkness For sanity theyve cried Cast aside your past life You have joined the enlightened pride The ancient blood will spill again Our numbers only grow Our temples raised, our hearts are pure The power in us flows Ill lead my people to the sun The time has come to go The vultures will feed and I will look down On the mangled far below"

We made the scene when we made a scene, And though it was brief, it meant everything. Oh what a pity, now theyre bound to make us saints Oh what a pity, now theyre bound to make us saints. Against this, even boys fight violently in vein. What chance could we have stood? We were the last of the lost, But now we are the first of the fashionably late.

"I am not only a color but lately 17 and 3 As the 11th will eventually die. Time is brief and never longer therefore I allow my shoulder to bury and all my fingers line one by one Then I can deny the black hole and deeply fold in a chasity of insights Next time we listen to your blood and it results in the sin of my strangled sprat as half watch the loud pitch laugh in your vicinity And the evilly humored temptation tarnish fruitbearing Suicide My saddle will skid no further into tomorrow And in 1955 the dead will die in the infernal oblivion of my own domain However, we wont conquer like Erinnyen in page two but rather stalk our soulless nature in 3 shades of grey To Caress a delusion sometimes causes a peculiar presence which behaves how a deeply sunken razor would sound in blood and consequently our echos let a glow in the breastless Bestiarium. No As my poisoned Shadows broke in two from the Zodiacal Light and only farther a displeased death of the struggling odoring Shock of a horned blade in the perfection of Animalistic Lust Decorating itself in a disgusting Vesture Bacchanten Climbed Icy Abysses yet, it wont Bring Forth the tender damnation Necessity to breed is blinded by the Oviparious yearn for death. And those not against God Lucifer are suspicious A dissolute force highhandedly requires danger When Death Rings for several luckless Maids Bluish Anarchy will instill over the Gates of Naked lust Only an elder enrichment of the boilingpoints to forgive my life Will the Blasphemic Origin contribute to all the Graven Feet of the downfall."

I lived in a painting by Renoir Dined late in those sidewalk cafes But lately I seem to be more inclined For a walk in the rain I dance to Grappelli and Django Saw candlelight through beaujolais But lately I seem to be more inclined For a walk in the rain We laughed at the weather Out walking without umbrellas How well I remember You face when we walked in the rain You know I was crazy about you Some sadness caused me to unwind Maybe I will meet you if fate is kind On a walk in the rain
"Not all who wander are lost Not all who come from past are ghosts He is the bringer of resolve To defeat ancestral foe One of those without the shade Hoary sentinel keeper of man From legend he comes our only hope Pathfinder on quest foretold Wanderer Im, without shade, without name Only few remember, legend about my race True quest of mine starts this day, hear my words carefully Now walk with me a lonely way of those without shade cos Im Shadowless He is the voice of the past, harbinger of legacy so dark Only united as one strong man We are able to stop chaos itself He is there to find four of his own blood On his shoulders lies a burden of our time Incredible venture and dangerous adventure He must face now primordial evil that walks again the earth"
"This cloudy morning theyre up today Another shit waged Sunday hand in hand the underpaid The underappreciated serving you till two or three The families in the freezing picking bottles off the street The afterglow it was glowing bright But the reality of the empty bottles quick turned off the lights Because theres the lady, the shopping cart Crying in the freezing but she doesnt have a frozen heart Theyre grinding with the gears, they have for years Evolution doesnt instill fear Because they have an appreciation for the common man With bottles in their hands its the end for most of them Complain today and for the rest of your days Spitting in the faces of the people who cater to you Consume the world giving orders To the souls with the hearts that are drowning in the shit wage Blues to you, this imbalance is serving right Corporate america sucking out the life so your kids wont have to fight For nothing, while laughing at the lady with the cart she smiles And waves because she doesnt have a frozen heart Theyre grinding with the gears, they have for years Evolution doesnt instill fear Because they have an appreciation for the common man With bottles in their hands its the end for most of them The sound, the struggle, barely hanging on Its the song you never sung and its the only song theyll ever know Sound of the struggle when theyre barely hanging on Its the song theyve always sung and its the only song theyll ever know Theyre grinding with the gears, they have for years Evolution doesnt instill fear Because they have an appreciation for the common man With bottles in their hands its the end for most of them The sound, the struggle, barely hanging on Its the song you never sung and its the only song theyll ever know Sound of the struggle when theyre barely hanging on Its the song theyve always sung and its the only song theyll ever know"
"Standing by the car in a silver thing Staring into space like an astronaut In a western town as the evening falls In the late summer in the far future You steal the scene You steal the scene Standing on the set, curling cigarettes In a body suit, getting in the mood For an action scene in the madmans dream When the cameras roll, you do your own stunts You steal the scene You steal the scene Standing on a chair, noose around your neck In a body suit catching everything Kick the chair away as the cameras rock Movies of your life flash before your eyes You steal the scene You steal the scene Now youre underground, added to the gate Tattered from the suit, every twitch and sigh Lie before your art in the public eye With your trademark smile changing all the time You steal the scene You steal the scene"
Now I walk alone Every waking hour This power I make my own Im not who Ive been Everything is changing Arranging this flight within Theyre looking for something Racing through this mad life Theres only one thing We can take this time I can show you I control you Welcome to my life I know you Ill conceal you I can heal you Of what you have become Now this times arrived Every waking moment I wanted to feel alive Breaking from the past I know Ill never have to Go back through Those places At long last All of us falling On the sacred roads theyve led us Hear the calling They will never forget us I can show you I control you Welcome to my life I know you Ill conceal you I can heal you Of what you have become

"Theres no hope, no goals. Its like weve lost all control. No meaning. No dreams. Its like weve lost any reason to be. You get so sure that its the end that you forget to try. You forget to live. Youve seen the worst, thought there was nothing left. Youve felt alone, felt left for dead. But we have been there too. Weve seen the walls close in, the light leave the room. Weve seen the world turn their backs, turn their backs on me. Weve been through far too much just to give up now. Life is too uncertain to be sure that things wont change. Dont wait for your life just to happen. But we have been there too. Weve seen the walls close in, the light leave the room. Weve seen the world turn their backs, but the fact that we all share this bond Is all the strength that I need to keep moving on. To prove to them that I wont remain on the ground. All of us have been knocked down before. Use the strength of each other to get off of the floor. Youre not alone. We know who you are. We all have the same scars. So when youve lost the will to carry on, know the night is darkest before the dawn. You cant carry the weight of the world on your own."

"Stellar flames create formations, Lucent constellations and invitations to the expeditious mind Novas that see our destination From their hibernation, a vocation that is enshrined Im navigating along the star path The night sky is my compass, my cynosure After days with waves of wrath Im finally reaching the shores Under the burning Atlas A region filled with flaring birthmarks Over ageing landmarks and the hallmarks of Natures grand form Yonder, still in our respiration And mother to rotation, gravitation that endlessly performs"

"Vesuvius Only Built for Cuban Linx... by Raekwon Opening Statement What do the following albums have in common? Madvillainy, Reasonable Doubt, It Was Written, Life After Death, American Gangster, The Night Took Us In Like Family, A Prince Among Thieves, section.80, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, and even Pure Heroine? The answer is simple theyre all heavily influenced by Only Built For Cuban Linx. In 1995, Cuban Linx became the third Wu Tang solo album. Notionally a Raekwon album, it features all nine members of the Wu Tang, including Ghostface on 12 of the 17 tracks. Blue Raspberry and Cappadonna also get minor roles, as does Nas. RZA handles the production, weaving in samples from gangster films. Combined with the intricate plot and large cast of characters ten of the rappers involved used aliases this gave the album a cinematic feel. If others had attempted it, they hadnt pulled it off nearly as well. This was the platform for albumbased rap. The Miseducation may be a million miles from Cuban Linx in topic, but the skits which provide its story and character probably wouldnt have been there without Raekwons own storytelling skits. Kendrick Lamars crossalbum storytelling has precedent elsewhere in music, but Raes fingerprints are all over section.80 in particular The actual content of the story has also been influential. Mafioso rap was an obscure subgenre in 1995. AZ was working on a Mafioso album of his own, and Kool G Rap was still plugging away, but it was Cuban Linx that captured the wider publics imagination. The three rappers now recognised as New Yorks greatest Biggie, Nas, and Jay Z all switched their styles when they heard or in Nass case, contributed to Cuban Linx. The selfindulgent hustlers of Reasonable Doubt and Life After Death were inspired by Lex Diamond. Nass Escobar persona was born in RZAs Staten Island studio. Even 2Pac started calling himself Makaveli thanks to the Gambino personas. Raekwons references to cristal saw it become a shorthand for wealth within hip hop, and even outside of it. Lorde uses cristal to represent the gap between successful musicians and their struggling fans Most of Cuban Linxs influence was immediate, but it is still influential today. Kendrick and Lorde are the tip of the iceberg Rick Ross has essentially built his career off OB4CL. Childish Gambino indirectly takes his rap name from the album. Combine a cinematic style and Mafioso themes, and you get LOrange and Jeremiah Jaes The Night Took Us In Like Family, the greatest underground album of 2015. That album is highly reminiscent of MF Doom and Madlibs Madvillainy. Indeed, Dooms comicbook personas probably wouldnt have been as successful if his friend Ghostface hadnt started calling himself Tony Starks on OB4CL, and nor would his cinematic production have been as widely accepted without RZAs contribution Only Built For Cuban Linx was an instant classic. The Mafioso fantasy delivered in a cinematic style is so compelling that it immediately had a huge impact upon hiphop, which continues today Rebuttal Closing Rakims influence on hip hop is not to be sold short. He was one of the first hip hop artists to rap like Chuck Berry or Bob Dylan. And whilst Follow The Leader might be his best record, its Paid In Full which is usually acknowledged as his most influential As influential as Rakim may be, Id argue that the developments he brought to the table were inevitable. Berry and Dylan already existed. Internal rhyming, complex schemes and multisyllabic rhymes were widespread both in poetry and in pop music. If Rakim hadnt dipped his toes in them, someone else would have. Maybe it would have been Big Daddy Kane, or Lord Finesse. Maybe it would have been a mediocre early 90s rapper. Wed still have got the rhymes. Contrastingly, Cuban Linx had to happen when it did. If the boat had been missed, Mafioso rap would never have taken off, and Jay Z and Nas would have had rather different careers Is influence alone enough? I would strongly argue it is not. Robert Johnsons influence upon hiphop is immeasurably bigger than Jay Zs, even though he died nearly 20 years before Clive Campbell was born. Theres little doubt, however, that Jay Zs music is better he stands on the shoulders of several decades worth of giants Cuban Linx may be dated and dusty, but I would argue it has stood the test of time rather better than Follow The Leader. Rhymes for their own sake are particularly dated, and theyre Rakims main trick. Rae, Ghost and the RZA provide lyricism that hits hard, and an album that works as a cohesive whole and a piece of art. Sure, its far from timeless but theres a lot more artistry on display TheRealSixGod Follow the Leader by Eric B . Rakim Opening Statement Rebuttal Closing"

"Forgive me father I was 7 hours late, and now youre gone But I made it next to you, as I promised Dressed you for your last journey Im dead to you now, still holding the words that were left unsaid Couldnt burden you wish the sorrows that crushed my chest Couldnt find the right time to share those words, why the days passed away Im dead to you now, and will be, until my own heart sees the fallen veil of night Until the curtains open for me, to walk the same moonlit silver trail, I always will be 7 hours late Carrying the pain of knowing, that you never know Why we both went through the days apart, but with the same shadows in our hearts I cant never tell you why I wasnt there, until they bury me in the same soil Until we meet again, I will be 7 hours late These rooms of shadows, echoes on these walls, this empire of loneliness Still feeling the presence, your soul still lingering here for a while And the dark that pours in through the nightside window And the light that fades into the woods Like fireflies dancing betweenthe rusted trees, the light that escaped from my side Glowing in the woods, waving its last goodbye until its gone And then its dark"

But sometimes you dont, and thats a blessing Cause we dont know it all and life is nothing but a lesson Open up your mind and stay away from the blinded In other words do the opposite of what I did cause finding Your way up out of trouble is nothing short of a struggle Door to the devil open, close it up before they stumble Their way in and get too comfortable, cause once they fall in love with you There aint no turning back youre cornered in sort of a puzzle Thats a warning from one who fell victim One who wonders and cries why hell picked em One who bundles and hides inside prisms Hoping someonell findem alive and buy sympa Thy, but he sees what you just might You dont know whats left, but you can do no right So assume no less than what you knows right Cause only you knows best, so dont lose yo life... And sometimes you make mistakes.. And sometimes you face the fate.. And sometimes you taste the cake.. But sometimes the plate is blank.. But that dont stop you from eating does it? Impossible reasoning, you been weakened and beaten But found the top and you seen above it People done hated you and theres got to be repercussion Forgotten the meaning of life, stop and proceed to love it Cause itll pass faster than a couple of blinks Does it really even matter what anotherll think? Nah.. So keep going, keep fighting, keep living Keep loving, keep breathing, keep at it, keep dreaming.. Believe in what you love, hatell come no matter what And I know at times you feel like youre done and youve had enough But timell heal it all, they wont ever see ya fall Give it a year or so I promise that youre gonna laugh it up And get out of this funk youre in, something in Me says that youre in need of one to put trust within Mustve been the past, so look at what is in front of you Forget about what coulda been, focus on what youre gonna do.. And sometimes your life is hard.. And sometimes you might dissolve.. And sometimes your flight is tall.. But sometimes your kitell fall.. And thats life, believe me Imma live it to fullest Cause you never when someone might confront you wit them bullets And that quick, your lifes gone, no more lights on So every night you better hope they playign the right song And it dont skip.. Cause if theres anything I know bout a gun and point blank, well it dont miss So it doesnt really matter what ya fist gon hit Cause a swingll turn to a pop when that pistol lit The world dont stop spinning so dont get locked in it Do only what you love, forget whats blocking in Theres plenty more to come and theres plenty to overcome So lay down a couple goals, and steadily go for one Never stay outta sight when enemies outta line Never be outta line, keep enemies outta sight Do only what you care tonight.. I can feel it in the air tonight, in the air tonight.. And sometimes your life is right.. And sometimes the light is bright.. And sometimes you fight the fight.. But one time tonights the night.."
"I took the 4 year old boy by the arm Told him we would play nice games at my place Once the door was closed his nightmare started I took a knife and planted it in his leg With another knife I made small wounds in his face I drank the blood that came out of it and chewed off his ear His tongue I pulled out, his skin I scalped Dead he lay on the floor, his pants full of shit I took a pot and cooked an ear, the lips ans skinparts Together with tomato juice and some herbs I ate it all Delicious... that boy was delicious..."

"Intro 00010 00042 You know as I look up at the sky, as I look up in the Heavens, I see the face of Jesus, I see God and I see the Holy Ghost. The bible says in Philippians 413 That I can do all things through Jesus Christ which strengthen me. Romans 323 For all that have sin and come short of the glory of God. And I wanna let you know today, that with God and Jesus, you can and will make it Chorus 00046 00130 When we give God the glory and we give him the praise, for everything thathe does for us for being the man, and for being the Savior, for givin us life, and for given us hope. When we serve Jesus, and we serve God, we pray for the world, and we confess our sins. Jesus is the only way, that you can ever see God, so accept Jesus before he takes you away Verse 1 00131 00216 We gotta learn that Jesus, is the number 1, person that sacrificed his life for everybody in the world nearly 2,000 years ago in the BC era. Before Christ came you had to sacrifice somebody, you had to sacrifice an animal to get forgiveness, but when Jesus died on the cross and he arose again on the 3rd day that lets us know that Chorus 00217 00302 When we give God the glory and we give him the praise, for everything thathe does for us for being the man, and for being the Savior, for givin us life, and for given us hope. When we serve Jesus, and we serve God, we pray for the world, and we confess our sins. Jesus is the only way, that you can ever see God, so accept Jesus before he takes you away Verse 2 00303 00347 When Jesus rose again on the 3rd day, that lets us know that we are forgiven. Jesus received a great beat down he didnt have to, but he did it anyway. God had a plan for everybody in life when the first couple was created, Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve, the bible has to be fulfilled in Jesus name and God gets the glory Chorus 00348 00434 When we give God the glory and we give him the praise, for everything thathe does for us for being the man, and for being the Savior, for givin us life, and for given us hope.

Until everyone is sleeping And the lights turn off in New York City And the girl in Hollywood They aint so thin and they aint so pretty And they aint writing songs in Nashville Done rolling dice in Vegas When Elvis aint king Loretta aint queen And there aint no blues in Memphis So its looking like never Looking like im never gonna stop loving you Its looking like never Looking like im never gonna stop loving you"
"Satanas lead us through. Through realms of crimson twilight, Where the serpent race heeds thy cult. Through the streams of Acheron, Where necromancers cast their spells. Through the eye of Black Chaos, Where dimensions cross and power dwells. Through the Hyperborean lands, Where ice and fire become one. Through the hidden caves of VR, Where the Lords of Sorcery live. Through the blackened plaions of hades, Where life is death and death is life. Satanas lead us through. Hail Satanas, Ave Satanas, Salve Satanas, Angel Fuck ! Through the burning fields of Hell, Where the blood of angels flows free. Through the forest of the elves, Where the pagans gather to feast. Through visions of future worlds, Where vultures feed upon the dead."

Spinning on this little ball If this footstool is your heaven Better hope this rock dont fall

In the sea lives a siren with the body of a goddess and a voice of silk able to break the will of even the strongest men. For all her looks and charm Dolus could have anything she desired. All but one thing Rex De Caelo king of the heavens. He was the only thing that was out of her reach or so it seemed. Dolus spent hours staring at the night sky pondering how she could have him. Finally she found a weak spot within the king. She began to plot and without mercy attacked Every morning the man on the isle of antilla would come to the edge of the shore and bathe himself in the oceans waters. At the same time the sun would peak over the horizon painting the sky beautiful hues of blood orange pinks and purples. The sun would shine a warm golden light upon the man and the same would happen before he would lie himself down to rest the last sliver of daylight would touch his chest. Dolus knew that this was the way to De Caelo...

"Moscow Rules The original protocol for operating in the presence of adversaries can be applied to cyber defense Bob Gourley 27 May 2013 CTOvision.com Lessons learned from US agents who operate in enemy territory have been captured for years and transformed into a code of conduct popularly known as Moscow Rules. Those old rules existed for a reason. Realworld experience proved their effectiveness when agents had to operate in the presence of adversaries Since modern cyber defenders are also frequently required to operate in the presence of adversaries there are lessons from these old Moscow Rules relevant to cyber defense With that as an introduction, the following is a modified list of the old Moscow Rules designed to help the cyber defender under fire Consider these as Moscow Rules for Cyber Operations Do not trust your gut. Your gut is not used to the manmade creations of cyberspace. Instrument, measure, monitor and seek to confirm everything Do not trust any single source of information. Seek multiple sources, especially sources from outside your organization Design your cyber defense monitoring system to bring all sources together for big data analysis. This includes structured network and computer derived information and also unstructured feeds from advisory reporting, vulnerability reports, social media and specialized cyber intelligence feeds Backup everything of importance to your mission, and keep unalterable logs. This will save you, again and again Understand your actions are being observed. Your adversary is watching you watch them you are never completely alone Every device in your system is potentially under opposition control. Your VOIP phone, your Telepresence system, your laptop, tablet and even cell phone, are all potentially compromised. Architect your enterprise to ensure penetrated systems are detected, isolated and their comms grounded Even in the complex heterogenous world of modern enterprise IT you can find boundaries and control points. Know where they are and how to leverage them to your advantage. Establish rules at every gate Protect your most important information, but seek to lull your adversary into a sense of complacency Dont harass the opposition. You want to enhance your defenses and keep them out. You do not want to emboldenencourage hatred. You want them to go away. More than likely you are not good enough at defending your own enterprise to even think of doing anything offensive. Save that for the government Keep your options open. Understand your adversary is a thinking, creative entity that will react and surprise you. The team you push out of your system may be replaced by a much more sophisticated team Know your tradecraft and make sure your entire team does as well many exemplars and best tradecraft practices are available, a favorite of mine is the community produced Consensus Audit Guidelines Training and education of your workforce is important, but it will fail you. Even with all the training in the world your workforce will eventually be deceived by creative, determined adversaires. Know that right now a user somewhere in your organization is doing something they should not be Be careful about outside consultants. The cyber defense field, unfortunately, attracts charlatans who assert that they have special knowledge of how to defend. The only way to vet experienced cyber defenders is to have either observed their past performance firsthand or to get firsthand reports by those you trust Pick the time and place for action. Move fast to protect your most important info. Take actions to keep your adversary off balance. Build plans in well thought out ways to raise all other info defenses on your schedule Understand the human tendency to forget about the threat as soon as the current attack has been mitigated. Do not fall victim to this cyber threat amnesia. When not under visible attack, study, prepare, and test your own defenses Have you had responsibilities for defending an enterprise in the face of adversaries? Does the list above resonate with you, or is any part of it out of whack with your experiences? I would appreciate your thoughts"

"Living a life without light I found my endless night Evil, when will you lose your wings? I bathe in glowing coals I live my saddest hour Hiding my joy, no escape, iron cages Anger for I know all is lost Its my night, endless night But Im not falling Cause I stand proud until the end When lights descend, And smiling is no more In my own endless night Peace ends at the moment Where selflonging begins Pain is running straight down my shoulders Breakup, fires ignite We burn, will be gone We are imprisoned in halls of shame This lonesome place keeps me inviolate Beautiful rain pouring from broken skies Treetops bending down with a sigh This is an endless night Hope for relief is gone You wear a gloomy shroud Hiding the sinning world"

"[Verse 1 MoJo King] Silently sliding in under the cover of night Swiftly slipping through defenses thought too tight Lightly armed with little more than grit and pick ax Still playing the game, even with decks stacked They know the deal, still dogged and determined Defying the common because of inner burning A constant urging to dig deep, never sleep Go below the surface and find what lies beneath On a last crusade, the dozen delve into the unknown Searching for something special to call their own Seemingly on a suicide mission, they continue their dissension For originality addicts its just a natural progression No longer aroused by the routine theyre graduating To dirtier stimulation, potency non abating Absolute, the dealer of power poetics they lust Giving hits when even the underground aint down enough [Hook] Its dirty... Keep digging Dozen... Keep digging [Verse 2 Vision the Iron Disciple] You were there to hold me down, there to lift me up When they left me in the street you put some change in my cup I gotta admit that when I fell nobody knew my name You were patiently waiting to reignite the flame So fresh and clean, but then you had to get dirty We buried so deep Im surprised you found us worthy Aint two ways about it, when my face was shrouded You scrapped the crust from the mantle, proceeded to break the handle On the shovel, pouring sweat like blood trying to reach me Drowning in nightmares, you were determined to beach me Shouldve known there was a remnant of the faithful few Who could taste the true, and this is made for you The air was poisoned with noise but somehow you stayed focused Archeologist eating wild honey and locusts On a dig of a lifetime, bringing us the lifeline Because weve been known with precision to kick precisely the right rhyme [Hook]"

Try to ascend, but always end up falling back into bed if I lay here forever, I might just sleep til Im dead, I... Havent been sober in weeks Faded, I cling to my sheets Hopin they give me relief from all these griefs Pull the comforter up over my head While looking for comfort in words once said Anything to fix my thoughts clear this mess I lay to rest, I feel my bed becoming my coffin These... visions of death they flash by often I keep on coughing, choking on the smoke I can feel the Reapers cold hands start to wrap around my throat... Lucid dream, my mind plays tricks on me Nothing is what it seems, I keep on trying to run, But it feels like I cant breathe Visions blurry, the scenery starts to change Stuck in this purgatory, everything starts to fade, maybe Ill sleep til the morning, hah... Maybe Ill never wake up It wouldnt be such a bad thing I feel stuck in a bad dream The bags under my eyes, theyre starting look like black holes they say the eyes are the window to the soul... [Hook IllNoize] if I fall asleep, please dont wake me up when I finally fall asleep, dont wake me up Eyes open, I lie awake, but my bodys numb Im wondering what my life has become? So if I fall asleep, please dont wake me up Yea when I finally fall asleep, dont wake me up My REM slowed from all of the drugs I feel them rushing through my veins, in my blood... [Verse 2Outro IllNoize] lately Ive been holding hands with the bottle Back to the weed smoke Another xanax to swallow, I feel hollow I need anything to put me at ease Something to clear my head give me peace Cure this disease... Just give me anything to make it stop... Or Ill just lay here in my darkened room until my fucking body rots, untying knots to everyone I know Seclude myself from everything...

"I know I wont change, I have tried Was feeling so caged, hands tied I cant find anything feeling so right, its blinding hope The reaper is close, seen his smile A matter of time, cant deny I wont turn around, around, around This destinys mine The countdown has begun the walls are falling down my life is on the line the freedom is mine... Its dangerous to sacrifice It makes your blood run to throw the dice Its dangerous, its what you like Its what youll die for to live this life Were going on and well never stop Were going on til worlds collide Its dangerous So dangerous Dangerous I know its not safe, close my eyes I search for the edge of life cause thats the only place Ill ever find that makes me whole A thief in the night, out of sight Its out there waiting to ignite the fever will rise, rise, rise taking over my mind The countdown has begun the walls are falling down my life is on the line the freedom is mine... Its dangerous to sacrifice It makes your blood run to throw the dice Its dangerous, its what you like Its what youll die for to live this life Were going on and well never stop Were going on til worlds collide Its dangerous So dangerous Dangerous Nothing matters anyhow Its like Im floating off the ground Into the hands of air I dive Rays of light flashing by Like the time is slowing down When the world is out of sight All the memories in my mind Wont leave me behind Its dangerous... dangerous Its dangerous... dangerous Its dangerous! Its dangerous to sacrifice It makes your blood run to throw the dice Its dangerous, its what you like Its what youll die for to live this life Were going on and well never stop Were going on til worlds collide Its dangerous So dangerous Dangerous"
"Another day enshrouded in mist Profound scars on my wrist I failed to live, I just exist Days of grievance still persist Shining dreams of a life divine Enshrined by the wheels of time A growing darkness on my mind Soon the cathedral bell will chime Alleviation of my pain be done I cannot stand who I have become I see my life flash before my eyes The cathedral bell chimes for me this time Another night enshrouded in grief No ascendance, no relief All hope turned to disbelief Wither away like autumn leaves In the eye of the October storm Every shred of warmth is torn My heart feels ill, my soul outworn I wish that I was never born Theres a beauty in all fading light A vivid gateway to a night divine Like a velvet caress, so benign Like a sacred unopened shrine Becoming mine Theres a waning garden in my dreams Over flooded by a thousand streams Streams of tears that makes me drown Sinking down, further down"
"It was too much in the house we lived in It was your man, I had known that it was him He looked around at us His eyes were bound and cross His face, dirty with rage Trees all gone, I walked home alone again The red and plush underneath your pillow The hill runs down to stay under the ground Ill crawl in there floating on sound You promised her, you promised her, shed laugh a little You promise her again, Ill take it all back You promised her, dont promise her, things shell never get, no I promised her that I would hold her hand One arm, two feet holding small like child If we could meet again just for a while In time we learn, dont fake the sound of pain In the road, dont cross without me You promised her, you promised her, shed laugh a little You promise her again, Ill take it all back You promised her, dont promise her, things shell never get, no I promised her that I would hold her hand"
"I this fractal illusion burning away all structure toward the obscene I to cleanse, to purge, to breach eternity and smother all life Blindthese mortal men of clay, divine and dying in their harassed form Ithis furnace of limitless hate. Bestial, pure The pendulum swings semiattached to the center of all I drug these minds into ruin and contemptthe acid smoke of burning souls This is an anomaly. Disabled. What is true? Not destined for incarceration, I crave my nothingness The illness that they whisper of, is that what makes me fail? I see through the eyes of the of the blind Not clear what it is to be this self I dread, the immense, the rabid I am The cogs turn, grinding away at ceaselessnesswilling it to dust Redisintegration. Convulse. A dead universeImpales this twilight Fear aligns. Sadistic me. Meant to devour. Despair Sickened by the fact that immortality is not mine to have. A snail along a straight razordividing itself through motion I charge this feeble product of god Laughing, drenched in the bile of millions Chewing on the stinking flesh of the crown of creation Solitude in splendor has been rivalled Shroud stained with tarblack vomit Veiling the rotting eyes of the masses The strain of Armageddon evolves Shifting through worlds from chaos, to chaos, to chaos I devour this manure of existenceinfertile, barren, whole Rancid redeemer. Virulent deterioration of faith Sacrilege in persona. In truth, fundamentally twisted A witness to this savage carnage. A frenzy of animosity The will to mutilate. Dominant deviation The worship of the sick and degenerate will spread I The nihilist, not the lunatic Ridding my godlike being of doubt Obliterating all hope of escape I Enter the echoes of despair Miracles inverted by default, a reflex to devastate Soaking in the will to violate, to castrate Soiling the purpose of mankind. Deus ex machina on hold The orgasmic, the splendid, the beginning of the end Conception derived from misconceptions The dimensionless features of truth Silence in the core of undoing Untie its knots and set it loose The inertia of my existence is clear Premutation of slaughtered worlds I alone will behold the dying sky A servant of eternity Progress finally, emergence of doom complete Here only to reverse the flow of life I"
"My destruction, immense and timeless, And I am the nemesis of man, Infinite is my power, this world I devour, But I am where it all began. I appall weakness, This entire planet is mine. As I continue my campaign against mankind, Lifeforms cower, I sit at the throne ov fallen enemies. Aegaeon, conqueror. Bow before the elite, exalted one. All shall witness the cosmic storm. Prophecies foretold of eternal flame consuming the entire planet. Putrid stench, scorched flesh circulates throughout the air. As you burn, your rapture realized in full, Commence the ritual, To bring the ending days of man. The ending days. The definition of depravity, The heirs to mankinds atrocity. This is my law, you will obey, The words ever clear. Condemn this whole world to suffering, One by one you shall bleed. Present thyself as an offering, Im the God you can see. Punished for their insolence, They are meek. Their foolish naive nature, Makes them weak. Breaking down their spirits, destroying their fantasies. I am who you should fear, I am the hateful all powerful. Gods of dust and sand, they want to never hunger with those who have created and they worship in the shadows of truth, Cowards and slaves of their desire, once freed, Will never come back, here. Killer of mankind is not war but fear. Destruction of humanity, The heirs to mankinds atrocities. This is my reign, and you will pray, The words ever clear. Condemn this whole world to suffering, One by one you shall bleed. Present thyself as an offering, Im the God you can see. I am the author I preach all that you need, The words that others believe, Designed for the weak and nave, All deserve to bleed, Serve to attach and deceive. Persist, pursued and persevered, And still by noone Im revered, Here I am, the puppeteer, The ropes they hang from made from fear. Im the God you can see."
Through my sleepless days Ive found That in my dreamless sleep Im bound To one night hear the sound Of you calling Do not stumble through tonight Have no fear of falling And if nobody got lost And if no one paid the cost The price of this you may surmise Is forever after We wont stumble through tonight Drowning in their laughter We wont stumble through tonight Drowning in their laughter From these moments we awake Our heads clear of the mistakes How we never hit the brakes Or felt it stalling Just dont stumble through tonight Have no fear of falling Dont stumble through tonight Have no fear of falling
"[Verse 1] Its always been up to your friends Theyll make your mind up for you The popularitys gone to your head But still I dont ignore you You ran for school election You even got my vote But you know my favourite pastimes poetry And yesterday I wrote [Chorus] Just because Im nerdy And my friends are flirty It doesnt mean that I swing that way Youve got complications And a reputation Wouldnt wanna get in your way Oh, anyway [Verse 2] This morning you walked past my door Just like a daydream But much more I followed you round to the store And I was shellshocked When I saw You and your friends were smoking It always makes me choke And did you know Id do anything to have you But I wouldnt take a toke Hey [Chorus] Just because im nerdy And my friends are flirty It doesnt mean that I swing that way Youve got complications And a reputation Wouldnt wanna get in your way Oh, anyway Anyway Oh, anyway [Break] You said my words were beautiful They almost made you cry The markings on the wall were jaded I wonder why [Chorus] Just because your nerdy And your friends are flirty Doesnt mean she wont swing your way Shes got complications And a reputation Go ahead and stand in her way [Chorus] Just because your nerdy And your friends are flirty Doesnt mean she wont swing your way Shes got complications And a reputation Go ahead and stand in her way But anyway"
"Just how many men, have paid the price of your gaze? An how many blinded heroes spending lost days in your maze Its power its reflection, your image was shown I turned turned around then I turned to stone... Look in your eyes I was told not to Look Look in your Everywhere I look I see your eyes And anywhere I go I see your eyes Ive been sentenced for a life in a frozen trance And Im doing time for a single stolen glance Look in your eyes I was bold enough to look Look in your eyes Now Im stone cold from the look Everywhere I look I see your eyes And anywhere I go I see your eyes Look in your eyes... I guess that Ive learned my lesson too late Now Ive seen your vision and its sealed my fate Everywhere I look I see your eyes And anywhere I go I see your eyes Every time I dream I see your eyes Forever I know, Ill see your eyes Everywhere I go..."
"The bus north was a rumbling gray coffin, evidence of my failure, like a tamed and crippled raptor. We passed a hitchhiker and I ducked, unwilling to see the disdain on his face. Returning to Boston was the first time Id ever gone back anywhere. For a decade my motto has been Always Forward, but that has taken me to a swamp and reduced me to a bus. Forward had become backwards I had six dollars when Shadrack met me in Boston. He kept remembering money hed borrowed in the past, enough to keep me in cigarettes and food. He also deigned to share with me the towel Id given him. I found work at a onehour photo store, producing imagery before the sentiment had time to fade. Since I was the only male and the only white, customers assumed I was the manager. I quit, tired of people believing lies about me. I wasnt an actor, painter, playwright, or poet. I was just one more nondescript person on the planet. Ponce de Leon died from a Seminoles arrow at age sixty, still trying to live the life of a youth. I would not make his mistake. I moved into an upscale rooming house and wrote some poems"
"Friends came and went They always have Some at my side They never left the fights The drinks, the youth Theyve passed Still in my heart Always thinking back Reminicse the arguments The innocence days grew cold They always do Stay gold Ill see you soon Theyve gone but not for long This is my ode To the kids, who fought side by side To the kids, who would talk and stay up all night To the kids, who made up our lives To the kids, who fought and lost to time Ill see you soon"

"It is the mind, which creates the world about us And even though we stand side by side My eyes will never see what is beheld by yours My heart wont respond to your touch Out of the caverns of the pain Like a child from the womb, stillborn Like a ghost from the tomb I arise and unbuild it again We dont see things as they are We see them as we are And all that we see or seem to be Is but a dream within a dream I see life blurred and shallow every day by day In this worlds theatre in which I stay Three Death gently descends, from spheres up high Staring into my cold and humid eyes Youre closing your eyes, try turning your head Away from the gloom, trying to forget But when I start to laugh, she mocks And when I cry she laughs... And hardens evermore her heart But when I start to laugh, she mocks And when I cry she laughs... All things come to the those who wait I say these words to make me glad But something answers, soft and sad They come... but often come too late Three Death gently descends, from spheres up high Staring into my cold and humid eyes Youre closing your eyes, try turning your head Away from the gloom, trying to forget But something answers, soft and sad They come... but often come too late Cause I am sick of this way of life As life is sick of the way we pretend But I have walked with Death hand in hand And Deaths own hand is warmer than my own! All things come to those who wait I say these words to make me glad But something answers, soft and sad They come... but often come too late"

Havent figured yet, sit at home alone Ask questions to the internet Like, Do the gods envy us Because we are fragile, flesh and blood So every single breath is a precious one? And if thats the case, who can we trust? Silence Heres something you can reference You want simple answers? Dont ask questions CHORUS BRIDGE So if you ask me how to proceed I would ask you Whats the aim? Cause, guns blazing, you could rush through Or take it frame by frame And you could say that is has no effect Cause the endings always the same But sometimes the ending changes Depending how you play the game So if you had the option to hit reset And do it all again, then who would you be next? Would you be the same self? A little better? Same type of story, switch a few letters? Waterproof skin to provide for the weather And a bulletproof heart underneath that sweater? Would you switch race? Change class? And I dont mean richpoor I mean like would you be a magician or a fighter Black belt, or something in between like a Red Mage And when they asked who would I rather be I looked em dead in the eyes and said Baje You know? With a few more dollars in the pocket But would my steps change if I was following a profit? Would I still walk like a man do? Or would I light up the stage and Wax a chump like a candle? Would they hear me? Would I listen, to the rhythm of the pistons? Or would I find out that were all gonna die And this whole time I coulda been fishin? CHORUS"

Once twilight descends Shadowing all that remains In the form of darkness Vermin prepare for the feast Once the ancients awaken Disturbing eternal slumber In the form of darkness Silent Voices from Beyond A bizarre manifestation Now comes forth to feed Pain shall turn to power This strength to compell Freedom from imprisonment Exiled through the galaxy To the darkest depths of space we shall descend... We shall storm this space and time As the true creators As the insects prepare for the feast Upon spread wings A writhing black mass Shall be sent from above Down on this untainted plane Enshrouded in mystery I know it has been written But now it is etched in stone And with this pen This date shall be saved So when I die Let it be told I will rise again In the unknown

Hysterical, not logical Is there room enough for all their shells? Pale forces in fake environment And biblical speeches so full of regret Strange voices so full of agony It sounds like it reaches deep into my head Suffocate, deliberate It is within, it is without Gestures, eyes and invocations It hides somewhere Waiting for he is yet to come... I begged for answers all my life Is it true crime to say the truth? This world is darker... This life is darker... ...darker than before"
"I came to the old house in the dark night I felt only a dark sensation, but no fright The strange old mans words ran through my mind In this unholy place, what would I find? I entered the mansion, thinking I was alone I saw a strange, ancient gravestone Suddenly a womans voice whispered my name Or was the old man playing a silly game? Aleidis came to me, unimaginably beautiful Dressed in white, while the moon was full Suddenly I felt overcome by an unholy desire But was she just young or an ages old vampire? Maybe she was just a portrait, or a figment of my sick mind But whatever the truth, she was the best wife Id ever find I loved her in a way I had never even known But would the blood my love needed soon be my own? She used to kill animals and suck their blood She belonged to Satan, her soul lost by God One day at last, she made my neck her unholy teeth feel Now we are joined for eternity, but is this all real?"

Torture and brutality i see through the eyes of insanity Dual instincts of perversity which i cannot escape from Twisted and deformed nightmares materialized in flesh Abnormal revel in pain labyrinth of mind Suffering in agony this night it happened again Distortion of my thoughts acts engraved by oblivion Burning the subconscious exhausting The body paralyzed The truth beyond all sense hear my silent cries Experience the fate unending nightmare It seems to be too late descending madness Schizophrenic fate Uncontrolled without restraint The quest for a normal life I need to be set free What have i done To deserve this fearful End this act of lunacy Existing to exterminate this other side of a soul Two faced personality in dismay searching for peace Looking inwards for answers to explain This situation of anguish Step by step the truth unfolds need to see the end Grand tornado of my inner soul Urgent need to kill the other side Within the boundaries of myself Subconscious lies Secrets only known in ancient tongues My search will never end Symptoms of insanity This other side must die How can i reach the unfathomable stairs To unlock the door to the nethermost regions ...Of my mind Increasing in velocity Illusions rapid fire Twisting my reality Act of lunacy im insane
"They killed more childrens in Rio today Their just kids in a mortal game Gunfire crosses the sky like a storm I dont know, but its smell like civil war One hundred and eleven prisioners in a hell Policemen trade crack and kill boys and girls The traffickers have more weapons than the arms I dont know but its smell like civil war Killers wipe out childrens in the churchs door Politicians goes to the tv talk about human rights The sacred war almost began When a freak kicked the gods mother face In the name of salvation Blood, sex, drugs in a city os pleasures Fear, pain, death in a country of carnival"
